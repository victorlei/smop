``SMOP`` is Small Matlab and Octave to Python compiler.
   ``SMOP`` translates matlab to python. Despite obvious similarities
   between matlab and numeric python, there are enough differences to
   make manual translation infeasible in real life.  ``SMOP`` generates
   human-readable python, which also appears to be faster than octave.
   Just how fast?  Timing results for "Moving furniture" are shown
   in Table 1. It seems that for this program, translation to python
   resulted in about two times speedup, and additional two times  speedup
   was achieved by compiling ``SMOP`` run-time library ``runtime.py``
   to C, using `cython`.  This pseudo-benchmark measures scalar
   performance, and my interpretation is that scalar computations are
   of less interest to the octave team.

   Downloaded ``mybench`` -- a collection of 20 or so
   micro-benchmarks originally meant to compare matlab and
   octave performance.  After succesfully running the first nine,
   the geometric mean of the speedup is 0.36,  which is cool.

   Version 0.26.3 is available for beta testing.
   Next version 0.27 is planned to compile octave
   ``scripts`` library, which contains over 120 KLOC in
   almost 1,000 matlab files. There  are 13 compilation
   errors with smop 0.26.3 .


Installation
============

+  Network installation is the best method if you just want it to
   run the example::

   $ easy_install smop --user

+  Install from the sources if you are behind a firewall::

   $ tar zxvf smop.tar.gz
   $ cd smop
   $ python setup.py install --user

+  Fork github repository if you need the latest fixes.

+  Finally, it is possible to use smop without doing the installation,
   but only if you already installed the dependences -- numpy
   and networkx::

   $ tar zxvf smop.tar.gz
   $ cd smop/smop
   $ python main.py solver.m
   $ python solver.py

+  You can launch the GUI the following way::

   $ cd smop/smop/GUI
   $ python smop_GUI.py

Working example
===============

We will translate ``solver.m`` to present a sample of smop features.  The
program was borrowed from the matlab programming competition in 2004 (Moving
Furniture).To the left is ``solver.m``.  To the right is ``a.py`` --- its
translation to python.  Though only 30 lines long, this
example shows many of the complexities of converting matlab code
to python.

.. code:: matlab

  01   function mv = solver(ai,af,w)  01 def solver_(ai,af,w,nargout=1):
  02   nBlocks = max(ai(:));          02     nBlocks=max_(ai[:])
  03   [m,n] = size(ai);              03     m,n=size_(ai,nargout=2)

====  =========================================================================
  02  Matlab uses round brackets both for array indexing and
      for function calls. To figure out which is which,
      SMOP computes local use-def information, and then
      applies the following rule: undefined names are
      functions, while defined are arrays.
----  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  03  Matlab function ``size`` returns variable number of
      return values, which corresponds to returning a tuple
      in python.  Since python functions are unaware of the
      expected number of return values, their number must be
      explicitly passed in ``nargout``.
====  =========================================================================

.. code:: matlab

  04   I = [0  1  0 -1];              04     I=matlabarray([0,1,0,- 1])
  05   J = [1  0 -1  0];              05     J=matlabarray([1,0,- 1,0])
  06   a = ai;                        06     a=copy_(ai)
  07   mv = [];                       07     mv=matlabarray([])

====  =========================================================================
  04  Matlab array indexing starts with one; python indexing
      starts with zero.  New class ``matlabarray`` derives from
      ``ndarray``, but exposes matlab array behaviour.  For
      example, ``matlabarray`` instances always have at least
      two dimensions -- the shape of ``I`` and ``J`` is [1 4].
----  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  06  Matlab array assignment implies copying; python
      assignment implies data sharing.  We use explicit copy
      here.
----  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  07  Empty ``matlabarray`` object is created, and then
      extended at line 28.  Extending arrays by
      out-of-bounds assignment is deprecated in matlab, but
      is widely used never the less.  Python ``ndarray``
      can't be resized except in some special cases.
      Instances of ``matlabarray`` can be resized except
      where it is too expensive.
====  =========================================================================

.. code:: matlab

  08   while ~isequal(af,a)           08     while not isequal_(af,a):
  09     bid = ceil(rand*nBlocks);    09         bid=ceil_(rand_() * nBlocks)
  10     [i,j] = find(a==bid);        10         i,j=find_(a == bid,nargout=2)
  11     r = ceil(rand*4);            11         r=ceil_(rand_() * 4)
  12     ni = i + I(r);               12         ni=i + I[r]
  13     nj = j + J(r);               13         nj=j + J[r]

====  =========================================================================
  09  Matlab functions of zero arguments, such as
      ``rand``, can be used without parentheses.  In python,
      parentheses are required.  To detect such cases, used
      but undefined variables are assumed to be functions.
----  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  10  The expected number of return values from the matlab
      function ``find`` is explicitly passed in ``nargout``.
----  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  12  Variables I and J contain instances of the new class
      ``matlabarray``, which among other features uses one
      based array indexing.

Random remarks
==============
With less than five thousands lines of python code
    ``SMOP`` does not pretend to compete with such polished
    products as matlab or octave.  Yet, it is not a toy.
    There is an attempt to follow the original matlab
    semantics as close as possible.  Matlab language
    definition (never published afaik) is full of dark
    corners, and ``SMOP`` tries to follow matlab as
    precisely as possible.

There is a price, too.
    The generated sources are
    `matlabic`, rather than `pythonic`, which means that
    library maintainers must be fluent in both languages,
    and the old development environment must be kept around.

Should the generated program be `pythonic` or `matlabic`?
    For example should array indexing start with zero
    (`pythonic`) or with one (`matlabic`)?

    I beleive now that some matlabic accent is unavoidable
    in the generated python sources.  Imagine matlab program
    is using regular expressions, matlab style.  We are not
    going to translate them to python style, and that code
    will remain forever as a reminder of the program's
    matlab origin.

    Another example.  Matlab code opens a file; fopen
    returns -1 on error.  Pythonic code would raise
    exception, but we are not going to do `that`.   Instead,
    we will live with the accent, and smop takes this to the
    extreme --- the matlab program remains mostly unchanged.

    It turns out that generating `matlabic`` allows for
    moving much of the project complexity out of the
    compiler (which is already complicated enough) and into
    the runtime library, where there is almost no
    interaction between the library parts.

.. missing grapphics library

Which one is faster --- python or octave?  I don't know.
  Doing reliable performance measurements is notoriously
  hard, and is of low priority for me now.  Instead, I wrote
  a simple driver ``go.m`` and ``go.py`` and rewrote `rand`
  so that python and octave versions run the same code.
  Then I ran the above example on my laptop.  The results
  are twice as fast for the python version.   What does it
  mean?  Probably nothing. YMMV.

.. code:: matlab

    ai = zeros(10,10);
    af = ai;

    ai(1,1)=2;
    ai(2,2)=3;
    ai(3,3)=4;
    ai(4,4)=5;
    ai(5,5)=1;

    af(9,9)=1;
    af(8,8)=2;
    af(7,7)=3;
    af(6,6)=4;
    af(10,10)=5;

    tic;
    mv = solver(ai,af,0);
    toc

Running the test suite::

     $ cd smop
     $ make check
     $ make test

Command-line options
--------------------

.. code:: sh

    lei@dilbert ~/smop-github/smop $ python main.py -h
    SMOP compiler version 0.25.1
    Usage: smop [options] file-list
        Options:
        -V --version
        -X --exclude=FILES      Ignore files listed in comma-separated list FILES
        -d --dot=REGEX          For functions whose names match REGEX, save debugging
                                information in "dot" format (see www.graphviz.org).
                                You need an installation of graphviz to use --dot
                                option.  Use "dot" utility to create a pdf file.
                                For example:
                                    $ python main.py fastsolver.m -d "solver|cbest"
                                    $ dot -Tpdf -o resolve_solver.pdf resolve_solver.dot
        -h --help
        -o --output=FILENAME    By default create file named a.py
        -o- --output=-          Use standard output
        -s --strict             Stop on the first error
        -v --verbose
