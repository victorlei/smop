This directory contains documentation in Doxygen format for
Octave's source code.  It is not created by default.

To produce Doxygen documentation use

make doxyhtml

Doxygen documentation can be helpful for developers of Octave, but is not
needed by users of Octave.  In addition, the documentation requires
approximately 1.2 GB of storage space.  For these reasons it is not maintained
under version control nor distributed in tarballs.
