<p>If you would like to write bug fixes or improvements for Octave, that is
very helpful.  When you send your changes, please follow these
guidelines to avoid causing extra work for us in studying the patches.
</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t follow these guidelines, your information might still be
useful, but using it will take extra work.  Maintaining Octave is a lot
of work in the best of circumstances, and we can&rsquo;t keep up unless you do
your best to help.
</p>
<ul>
<li> Send an explanation with your changes of what problem they fix or what
improvement they bring about.  For a bug fix, just include a copy of the
bug report, and explain why the change fixes the bug.

</li><li> Always include a proper bug report for the problem you think you have
fixed.  We need to convince ourselves that the change is right before
installing it.  Even if it is right, we might have trouble judging it if
we don&rsquo;t have a way to reproduce the problem.

</li><li> Include all the comments that are appropriate to help people reading the
source in the future understand why this change was needed.

</li><li> Don&rsquo;t mix together changes made for different reasons.
Send them <em>individually</em>.

<p>If you make two changes for separate reasons, then we might not want to
install them both.  We might want to install just one.
</p>
</li><li> Use &lsquo;<samp>diff -c</samp>&rsquo; to make your diffs.  Diffs without context are hard
for us to install reliably.  More than that, they make it hard for us to
study the diffs to decide whether we want to install them.  Unified diff
format is better than contextless diffs, but not as easy to read as
&lsquo;<samp>-c</samp>&rsquo; format.

<p>If you have GNU diff, use &lsquo;<samp>diff -cp</samp>&rsquo;, which shows the name of the
function that each change occurs in.
</p>
</li><li> Write the change log entries for your changes.

<p>Read the <samp>ChangeLog</samp> file to see what sorts of information to put
in, and to learn the style that we use.  The purpose of the change log
is to show people where to find what was changed.  So you need to be
specific about what functions you changed; in large functions, it&rsquo;s
often helpful to indicate where within the function the change was made.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, once you have shown people where to find the change,
you need not explain its purpose.  Thus, if you add a new function, all
you need to say about it is that it is new.  If you feel that the
purpose needs explaining, it probably does&mdash;but the explanation will be
much more useful if you put it in comments in the code.
</p>
<p>If you would like your name to appear in the header line for who made
the change, send us the header line.
</p></li></ul>
