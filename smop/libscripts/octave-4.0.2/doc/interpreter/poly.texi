@node Polynomial Manipulations
@chapter Polynomial Manipulations

In Octave, a polynomial is represented by its coefficients (arranged
in descending order).  For example, a vector @var{c} of length
@math{N+1} corresponds to the following polynomial of order
@tex
 $N$
$$
 p (x) = c_1 x^N + \ldots + c_N x + c_{N+1}.
$$
@end tex
@ifnottex
 @var{N}

@example
p(x) = @var{c}(1) x^@var{N} + @dots{} + @var{c}(@var{N}) x + @var{c}(@var{N}+1).
@end example

@node Evaluating Polynomials
@section Evaluating Polynomials

The value of a polynomial represented by the vector @var{c} can be evaluated
at the point @var{x} very easily, as the following example shows:

@example
@group
N = length (c) - 1;
val = dot (x.^(N:-1:0), c);
@end group
@end example

@noindent
While the above example shows how easy it is to compute the value of a
polynomial, it isn't the most stable algorithm.  With larger polynomials
you should use more elegant algorithms, such as Horner's Method, which
is exactly what the Octave function @code{polyval} does.

In the case where @var{x} is a square matrix, the polynomial given by
@var{c} is still well-defined.  As when @var{x} is a scalar the obvious
implementation is easily expressed in Octave, but also in this case
more elegant algorithms perform better.  The @code{polyvalm} function
provides such an algorithm.

@c polyval scripts/polynomial/polyval.m
@anchor{XREFpolyval}
@deftypefn  {Function File} {@var{y} =} polyval (@var{p}, @var{x})
@deftypefnx {Function File} {@var{y} =} polyval (@var{p}, @var{x}, [], @var{mu})
@deftypefnx {Function File} {[@var{y}, @var{dy}] =} polyval (@var{p}, @var{x}, @var{s})
@deftypefnx {Function File} {[@var{y}, @var{dy}] =} polyval (@var{p}, @var{x}, @var{s}, @var{mu})

Evaluate the polynomial @var{p} at the specified values of @var{x}.

If @var{x} is a vector or matrix, the polynomial is evaluated for each of
the elements of @var{x}.

When @var{mu} is present, evaluate the polynomial for
(@var{x}-@var{mu}(1))/@var{mu}(2).

In addition to evaluating the polynomial, the second output represents the
prediction interval, @var{y} +/- @var{dy}, which contains at least 50% of
the future predictions.  To calculate the prediction interval, the
structured variable @var{s}, originating from @code{polyfit}, must be
supplied.

@deftypefn {Function File} {} polyvalm (@var{c}, @var{x})
Evaluate a polynomial in the matrix sense.

@code{polyvalm (@var{c}, @var{x})} will evaluate the polynomial in the
matrix sense, i.e., matrix multiplication is used instead of element by
element multiplication as used in @code{polyval}.

The argument @var{x} must be a square matrix.

@node Finding Roots
@section Finding Roots

Octave can find the roots of a given polynomial.  This is done by computing
the companion matrix of the polynomial (see the @code{compan} function
for a definition), and then finding its eigenvalues.

@c roots scripts/polynomial/roots.m
@anchor{XREFroots}
@deftypefn {Function File} {} roots (@var{c})

Compute the roots of the polynomial @var{c}.

For a vector @var{c} with @math{N} components, return the roots of the
polynomial
@tex
$$
c_1 x^{N-1} + \cdots + c_{N-1} x + c_N.
$$
@end tex
@ifnottex

@example
c(1) * x^(N-1) + @dots{} + c(N-1) * x + c(N)
@end example

@end ifnottex

As an example, the following code finds the roots of the quadratic
polynomial
@tex
$$ p(x) = x^2 - 5. $$
@end tex
@ifnottex

@example
p(x) = x^2 - 5.
@end example

@end ifnottex

@example
@group
c = [1, 0, -5];
roots (c)
@result{}  2.2361
@result{} -2.2361
@end group
@end example

Note that the true result is
@tex
$\pm \sqrt{5}$
@end tex
@ifnottex
@math{+/- sqrt(5)}
@end ifnottex
which is roughly
@tex
$\pm 2.2361$.

Given an @var{n*n} matrix polynomial

@code{@var{C}(s) = @var{C0} + @var{C1} s + @dots{} + @var{Cl} s^l}

@code{polyeig} solves the eigenvalue problem

@code{(@var{C0} + @var{C1} + @dots{} + @var{Cl})v = 0}.

Note that the eigenvalues @var{z} are the zeros of the matrix polynomial.
@var{z} is a row vector with @var{n*l} elements.  @var{v} is a matrix
(@var{n} x @var{n}*@var{l}) with columns that correspond to the

@deftypefnx {Function File} {[@var{multp}, @var{idxp}] =} mpoles (@var{p}, @var{tol}, @var{reorder})
Identify unique poles in @var{p} and their associated multiplicity.

The output is ordered from largest pole to smallest pole.

If the relative difference of two poles is less than @var{tol} then they are
considered to be multiples.  The default value for @var{tol} is 0.001.

If the optional parameter @var{reorder} is zero, poles are not sorted.

The output @var{multp} is a vector specifying the multiplicity of the poles.
@code{@var{multp}(n)} refers to the multiplicity of the Nth pole
@code{@var{p}(@var{idxp}(n))}.

For example:

@deftypefn  {Function File} {} conv (@var{a}, @var{b})
@deftypefnx {Function File} {} conv (@var{a}, @var{b}, @var{shape})
Convolve two vectors @var{a} and @var{b}.

Find the greatest common divisor of two polynomials.

This is equivalent to the polynomial found by multiplying together all the
common roots.  Together with deconv, you can reduce a ratio of two
polynomials.

The tolerance @var{tol} defaults to @code{sqrt (eps)}.

@strong{Caution:} This is a numerically unstable algorithm and should not

@deftypefnx {Function File} {[@var{b}, @var{a}] =} residue (@var{r}, @var{p}, @var{k}, @var{e})
The first calling form computes the partial fraction expansion for the
quotient of the polynomials, @var{b} and @var{a}.

The quotient is defined as
@tex
$$
{B(s)\over A(s)} = \sum_{m=1}^M {r_m\over (s-p_m)^e_m}
  + \sum_{i=1}^N k_i s^{N-i}.

@end group
@end example

@end ifnottex
@noindent
where @math{M} is the number of poles (the length of the @var{r}, @var{p},
and @var{e}), the @var{k} vector is a polynomial of order @math{N-1}
representing the direct contribution, and the @var{e} vector specifies the
multiplicity of the m-th residue's pole.

For example,

@example
@group
b = [1, 1, 1];
a = [1, -5, 8, -4];
[r, p, k, e] = residue (b, a)
   @result{} r = [-2; 7; 3]

   @result{} k = [](0x0)
   @result{} e = [1; 2; 1]
@end group

@noindent
which represents the following partial fraction expansion
@tex
$$

$$
@end tex

   s^3 - 5s^2 + 8s - 4   (s-2)   (s-2)^2   (s-1)
@end group
@end example

@end ifnottex

The second calling form performs the inverse operation and computes the
reconstituted quotient of polynomials, @var{b}(s)/@var{a}(s), from the
partial fraction expansion; represented by the residues, poles, and a direct
polynomial specified by @var{r}, @var{p} and @var{k}, and the pole
multiplicity @var{e}.

If the multiplicity, @var{e}, is not explicitly specified the multiplicity is
determined by the function @code{mpoles}.

For example:

@example
@group
r = [-2; 7; 3];
p = [2; 2; 1];
k = [1, 0];
[b, a] = residue (r, p, k)
   @result{} b = [1, -5, 9, -3, 1]
   @result{} a = [1, -5, 8, -4]

where mpoles is used to determine e = [1; 2; 1]
@end group
@end example

Alternatively the multiplicity may be defined explicitly, for example,

@example
@group
r = [7; 3; -2];
p = [2; 1; 2];
k = [1, 0];
e = [2; 1; 1];
[b, a] = residue (r, p, k, e)
   @result{} b = [1, -5, 9, -3, 1]
   @result{} a = [1, -5, 8, -4]
@end group
@end example

@noindent
which represents the following partial fraction expansion
@tex
$$
{-2\over s-2} + {7\over (s-2)^2} + {3\over s-1} + s = {s^4-5s^3+9s^2-3s+1\over s^3-5s^2+8s-4}

@node Polynomial Interpolation
@section Polynomial Interpolation

Octave comes with good support for various kinds of interpolation,
most of which are described in @ref{Interpolation}.  One simple alternative
to the functions described in the aforementioned chapter, is to fit
a single polynomial, or a piecewise polynomial (spline) to some given
data points.  To avoid a highly fluctuating polynomial, one most often
wants to fit a low-order polynomial to data.  This usually means that it
is necessary to fit the polynomial in a least-squares sense, which just
is what the @code{polyfit} function does.

@c polyfit scripts/polynomial/polyfit.m
@anchor{XREFpolyfit}
@deftypefn  {Function File} {@var{p} =} polyfit (@var{x}, @var{y}, @var{n})
@deftypefnx {Function File} {[@var{p}, @var{s}] =} polyfit (@var{x}, @var{y}, @var{n})
@deftypefnx {Function File} {[@var{p}, @var{s}, @var{mu}] =} polyfit (@var{x}, @var{y}, @var{n})
Return the coefficients of a polynomial @var{p}(@var{x}) of degree
@var{n} that minimizes the least-squares-error of the fit to the points
@code{[@var{x}, @var{y}]}.

If @var{n} is a logical vector, it is used as a mask to selectively force
the corresponding polynomial coefficients to be used or ignored.

The polynomial coefficients are returned in a row vector.

The optional output @var{s} is a structure containing the following fields:

@table @samp
@item R
Triangular factor R from the QR@tie{}decomposition.

@item X
The Vandermonde matrix used to compute the polynomial coefficients.

@item C
The unscaled covariance matrix, formally equal to the inverse of
@var{x'}*@var{x}, but computed in a way minimizing roundoff error
propagation.

@item df
The degrees of freedom.

@item normr
The norm of the residuals.

@item yf
The values of the polynomial for each value of @var{x}.
@end table

The second output may be used by @code{polyval} to calculate the
statistical error limits of the predicted values.  In particular, the
standard deviation of @var{p} coefficients is given by

@code{sqrt (diag (s.C)/s.df)*s.normr}.

When the third output, @var{mu}, is present the coefficients, @var{p}, are
associated with a polynomial in

@code{@var{xhat} = (@var{x} - @var{mu}(1)) / @var{mu}(2)} @*
where @var{mu}(1) = mean (@var{x}), and @var{mu}(2) = std (@var{x}).

In situations where a single polynomial isn't good enough, a solution
is to use several polynomials pieced together.  The function
@code{splinefit} fits a peicewise polynomial (spline) to a set of
data.

@anchor{XREFsplinefit}
@deftypefn  {Function File} {@var{pp} =} splinefit (@var{x}, @var{y}, @var{breaks})

@deftypefnx {Function File} {@var{pp} =} splinefit (@dots{}, "constraints", @var{constraints})

Fit a piecewise cubic spline with breaks (knots) @var{breaks} to the
noisy data, @var{x} and @var{y}.

@var{x} is a vector, and @var{y} is a vector or N-D array.  If @var{y} is an
N-D array, then @var{x}(j) is matched to @var{y}(:,@dots{},:,j).

@var{p} is a positive integer defining the number of intervals along @var{x},
and @var{p}+1 is the number of breaks.  The number of points in each interval
differ by no more than 1.

The optional property @var{periodic} is a logical value which specifies
whether a periodic boundary condition is applied to the spline.  The
length of the period is @code{max (@var{breaks}) - min (@var{breaks})}.
The default value is @code{false}.

The optional property @var{robust} is a logical value which specifies
if robust fitting is to be applied to reduce the influence of outlying
data points.  Three iterations of weighted least squares are performed.
Weights are computed from previous residuals.  The sensitivity of outlier
identification is controlled by the property @var{beta}.  The value of
@var{beta} is restricted to the range, 0 < @var{beta} < 1.  The default
value is @var{beta} = 1/2.  Values close to 0 give all data equal
weighting.  Increasing values of @var{beta} reduce the influence of
outlying data.  Values close to unity may cause instability or rank
deficiency.

The fitted spline is returned as a piecewise polynomial, @var{pp}, and
may be evaluated using @code{ppval}.

The splines are constructed of polynomials with degree @var{order}.
The default is a cubic, @var{order}=3.  A spline with P pieces has
P+@var{order} degrees of freedom.  With periodic boundary conditions
the degrees of freedom are reduced to P.

The optional property, @var{constaints}, is a structure specifying linear
constraints on the fit.  The structure has three fields, @qcode{"xc"},
@qcode{"yc"}, and @qcode{"cc"}.

@table @asis
@item @qcode{"xc"}
Vector of the x-locations of the constraints.

@item @qcode{"yc"}
Constraining values at the locations @var{xc}.
The default is an array of zeros.

@item @qcode{"cc"}
Coefficients (matrix).  The default is an array of ones.  The number of
rows is limited to the order of the piecewise polynomials, @var{order}.
@end table

Constraints are linear combinations of derivatives of order 0 to
@var{order}-1 according to

@example
@group
@tex
$cc(1,j) \cdot y(xc(j)) + cc(2,j) \cdot y\prime(xc(j)) + ... = yc(:,\dots,:,j)$.
@end tex
@ifnottex
cc(1,j) * y(xc(j)) + cc(2,j) * y'(xc(j)) + ... = yc(:,...,:,j).

The number of @var{breaks} (or knots) used to construct the piecewise
polynomial is a significant factor in suppressing the noise present in
the input data, @var{x} and @var{y}.  This is demonstrated by the example
below.

@example
@group
x = 2 * pi * rand (1, 200);
y = sin (x) + sin (2 * x) + 0.2 * randn (size (x));
## Uniform breaks
breaks = linspace (0, 2 * pi, 41); % 41 breaks, 40 pieces
pp1 = splinefit (x, y, breaks);
## Breaks interpolated from data
pp2 = splinefit (x, y, 10);  % 11 breaks, 10 pieces
## Plot
xx = linspace (0, 2 * pi, 400);

y2 = ppval (pp2, xx);

@end ifnotinfo

The piecewise polynomial fit, provided by @code{splinefit}, has
continuous derivatives up to the @var{order}-1.  For example, a cubic fit
has continuous first and second derivatives.  This is demonstrated by
the code

@example
## Data (200 points)
x = 2 * pi * rand (1, 200);
y = sin (x) + sin (2 * x) + 0.1 * randn (size (x));
## Piecewise constant
pp1 = splinefit (x, y, 8, "order", 0);
## Piecewise linear
pp2 = splinefit (x, y, 8, "order", 1);
## Piecewise quadratic
pp3 = splinefit (x, y, 8, "order", 2);
## Piecewise cubic
pp4 = splinefit (x, y, 8, "order", 3);
## Piecewise quartic

When the underlying function to provide a fit to is periodic, @code{splinefit}
is able to apply the boundary conditions needed to manifest a periodic fit.
This is demonstrated by the code below.

@example
@group
## Data (100 points)
x = 2 * pi * [0, (rand (1, 98)), 1];
y = sin (x) - cos (2 * x) + 0.2 * randn (size (x));
## No constraints
pp1 = splinefit (x, y, 10, "order", 5);
## Periodic boundaries
pp2 = splinefit (x, y, 10, "order", 5, "periodic", true);
## Plot
xx = linspace (0, 2 * pi, 400);
y1 = ppval (pp1, xx);
y2 = ppval (pp2, xx);

@caption{Comparison of piecewise polynomial fits to a noisy periodic
function with, and without, periodic boundary conditions.}
@end float
@end ifnotinfo

More complex constraints may be added as well.  For example, the code below
illustrates a periodic fit with values that have been clamped at the endpoints,
and a second periodic fit which is hinged at the endpoints.

@example
## Data (200 points)
x = 2 * pi * rand (1, 200);
y = sin (2 * x) + 0.1 * randn (size (x));
## Breaks
breaks = linspace (0, 2 * pi, 10);
## Clamped endpoints, y = y' = 0
xc = [0, 0, 2*pi, 2*pi];
cc = [(eye (2)), (eye (2))];
con = struct ("xc", xc, "cc", cc);
pp1 = splinefit (x, y, breaks, "constraints", con);
## Hinged periodic endpoints, y = 0
con = struct ("xc", 0);
pp2 = splinefit (x, y, breaks, "constraints", con, "periodic", true);
## Plot
xx = linspace (0, 2 * pi, 400);
y1 = ppval (pp1, xx);
y2 = ppval (pp2, xx);

The @code{splinefit} function also provides the convenience of a @var{robust}
fitting, where the effect of outlying data is reduced.  In the example below,
three different fits are provided.  Two with differing levels of outlier
suppression and a third illustrating the non-robust solution.

@example
## Data
x = linspace (0, 2*pi, 200);
y = sin (x) + sin (2 * x) + 0.05 * randn (size (x));
## Add outliers
x = [x, linspace(0,2*pi,60)];
y = [y, -ones(1,60)];
## Fit splines with hinged conditions
con = struct ("xc", [0, 2*pi]);
## Robust fitting, beta = 0.25
pp1 = splinefit (x, y, 8, "constraints", con, "beta", 0.25);
## Robust fitting, beta = 0.75
pp2 = splinefit (x, y, 8, "constraints", con, "beta", 0.75);
## No robust fitting
pp3 = splinefit (x, y, 8, "constraints", con);
## Plot
xx = linspace (0, 2*pi, 400);
y1 = ppval (pp1, xx);
y2 = ppval (pp2, xx);
y3 = ppval (pp3, xx);

The function, @code{ppval}, evaluates the piecewise polynomials, created
by @code{mkpp} or other means, and @code{unmkpp} returns detailed
information about the piecewise polynomial.

The following example shows how to combine two linear functions and a
quadratic into one function.  Each of these functions is expressed
on adjoined intervals.

@example
@group
x = [-2, -1, 1, 2];
p = [ 0,  1, 0;
      1, -2, 1;
      0, -1, 1 ];
pp = mkpp (x, p);
xi = linspace (-2, 2, 50);
yi = ppval (pp, xi);

@deftypefnx {Function File} {@var{pp} =} mkpp (@var{breaks}, @var{coefs}, @var{d})

Construct a piecewise polynomial (pp) structure from sample points
@var{breaks} and coefficients @var{coefs}.

@var{breaks} must be a vector of strictly increasing values.  The number of
intervals is given by @code{@var{ni} = length (@var{breaks}) - 1}.

When @var{m} is the polynomial order @var{coefs} must be of size:
@var{ni} x @var{m} + 1.

The i-th row of @var{coefs}, @code{@var{coefs} (@var{i},:)}, contains the
coefficients for the polynomial over the @var{i}-th interval, ordered from
highest (@var{m}) to lowest (@var{0}).

@var{coefs} may also be a multi-dimensional array, specifying a vector-valued
or array-valued polynomial.  In that case the polynomial order is defined
by the length of the last dimension of @var{coefs}.  The size of first
dimension(s) are given by the scalar or vector @var{d}.  If @var{d} is not
given it is set to @code{1}.  In any case @var{coefs} is reshaped to a 2-D

the characteristic polynomial of @var{A}.

For example, the following code finds the eigenvalues of @var{A} which are
the roots of @code{poly (@var{A})}.

@example
@group

In fact, all three eigenvalues are exactly 1 which emphasizes that for
numerical performance the @code{eig} function should be used to compute
eigenvalues.
