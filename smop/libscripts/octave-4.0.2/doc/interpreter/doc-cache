     Read the audio signal Y from the RIFF/WAVE sound file FILENAME.

     If the file contains multichannel data, then Y is a matrix with the channels represented as columns.

     If N is specified, only the first N samples of the file are returned.  If [N1 N2] is specified, only the range of samples from N1 to N2 is returned.  A value of 'Inf' can be used to represent the total number of samples in the file.

     If the option "size" is given, then the size of the audio signal is returned instead of the data.  The size is returned in a row vector of the form [SAMPLES CHANNELS].  If there are two output arguments, the number of samples is assigned to the first and the number of channels is assigned to the second.

     The optional return value FS is the sample rate of the audio file in Hz.  The optional return value NBITS is the number of bits per sample as encoded in the file.

     'delaunay3' is deprecated and will be removed in Octave version 4.4.  Please use 'delaunay' in all new code.

     Compute the Delaunay triangulation for a 3-D set of points.  The return value TETR is a set of tetrahedrons which satisfies the Delaunay circum-circle criterion, i.e., only a single data point from [X, Y, Z] is within the circum-circle of the defining tetrahedron.

     The set of tetrahedrons TETR is a matrix of size [n, 4].  Each row defines a tetrahedron and the four columns are the four vertices of the tetrahedron.  The value of 'TETR(i,j)' is an index into X, Y, Z for the location of the j-th vertex of the i-th tetrahedron.

     An optional fourth argument, which must be a string or cell array of strings, contains options passed to the underlying qhull command.  See the documentation for the Qhull library for details <http://www.qhull.org/html/qh-quick.htm#options>.  The default options are '{"Qt", "Qbb", "Qc", "Qz"}'.

     If OPTIONS is not present or '[]' then the default arguments are used.  Otherwise, OPTIONS replaces the default argument list.  To append user options to the defaults it is necessary to repeat the default arguments in OPTIONS.  Use a null string to pass no arguments.

 -- Function File: YI = interp1q (X, Y, XI)
     One-dimensional linear interpolation without error checking.  Interpolates Y, defined at the points X, at the points XI.  The sample points X must be a strictly monotonically increasing column vector.  If Y is a matrix or an N-dimensional array, the interpolation is performed on each column of Y.  If Y is a vector, it must be a column vector of the same length as X.

     Values of XI beyond the endpoints of the interpolation result in NA being returned.

     Note that the error checking is only a significant portion of the execution time of this 'interp1' if the size of the input arguments is relatively small.  Therefore, the benefit of using 'interp1q' is relatively small.

     'loadaudio' is deprecated and will be removed in Octave version 4.4.  Please use 'audioread' in all new code.

     Load audio data from the file 'NAME.EXT' into the vector X.

     The extension EXT determines how the data in the audio file is interpreted; the extensions 'lin' (default) and 'raw' correspond to linear, the extensions 'au', 'mu', or 'snd' to mu-law encoding.

     The argument BPS can be either 8 (default) or 16, and specifies the number of bits per sample used in the audio file.

 -- Built-in Function: [L, U, P, Q] = luinc (A, DROPTOL)

     'luinc' is deprecated and will be removed in Octave version 4.4.  Please use 'ilu' or 'ichol' in all new code.

     Produce the incomplete LU factorization of the sparse matrix A.  Two types of incomplete factorization are possible, and the type is determined by the second argument to 'luinc'.

     Called with a second argument of '0', the zero-level incomplete LU factorization is produced.  This creates a factorization of A where the position of the nonzero arguments correspond to the same positions as in the matrix A.

     Alternatively, the fill-in of the incomplete LU factorization can be controlled through the variable DROPTOL or the structure OPTS.  The UMFPACK multifrontal factorization code by Tim A. Davis is used for the incomplete LU factorization, (availability <http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/umfpack/>)

     DROPTOL determines the values below which the values in the LU  factorization are dropped and replaced by zero.  It must be a positive scalar, and any values in the factorization whose absolute value are less than this value are dropped, expect if leaving them increase the sparsity of the matrix.  Setting DROPTOL to zero results in a complete LU factorization which is the default.

     OPTS is a structure containing one or more of the fields

     'droptol'
          The drop tolerance as above.  If OPTS only contains 'droptol' then this is equivalent to using the variable DROPTOL.

     'milu'
          A logical variable flagging whether to use the modified incomplete LU  factorization.  In the case that 'milu' is true, the dropped values are subtracted from the diagonal of the matrix U of the factorization.  The default is 'false'.

     'udiag'
          A logical variable that flags whether zero elements on the diagonal of U should be replaced with DROPTOL to attempt to avoid singular factors.  The default is 'false'.

     'thresh'
          Defines the pivot threshold in the interval [0,1].  Values outside that range are ignored.

     All other fields in OPTS are ignored.  The outputs from 'luinc' are the same as for 'lu'.

     Given the string argument \"vector\", 'luinc' returns the values of P Q as vector values.

 -- Function File: accumarray (SUBS, VALS, SZ, FUNC, FILLVAL, ISSPARSE)
 -- Function File: accumarray (SUBS, VALS, ...)

     Create an array by accumulating the elements of a vector into the positions defined by their subscripts.

     The subscripts are defined by the rows of the matrix SUBS and the values by VALS.  Each row of SUBS corresponds to one of the values in VALS.  If VALS is a scalar, it will be used for each of the row of SUBS.  If SUBS is a cell array of vectors, all vectors must be of the same length, and the subscripts in the Kth vector must correspond to the Kth dimension of the result.

     The size of the matrix will be determined by the subscripts themselves.  However, if SZ is defined it determines the matrix size.  The length of SZ must correspond to the number of columns in SUBS.  An exception is if SUBS has only one column, in which case SZ may be the dimensions of a vector and the subscripts of SUBS are taken as the indices into it.

     The default action of 'accumarray' is to sum the elements with the same subscripts.  This behavior can be modified by defining the FUNC function.  This should be a function or function handle that accepts a column vector and returns a scalar.  The result of the function should not depend on the order of the subscripts.

     The elements of the returned array that have no subscripts associated with them are set to zero.  Defining FILLVAL to some other value allows these values to be defined.  This behavior changes, however, for certain values of FUNC.  If FUNC is 'min' (respectively, 'max') then the result will be filled with the minimum (respectively, maximum) integer if VALS is of integral type, logical false (respectively, logical true) if VALS is of logical type, zero if FILLVAL is zero and all values are non-positive (respectively, non-negative), and NaN otherwise.

     By default 'accumarray' returns a full matrix.  If ISSPARSE is logically true, then a sparse matrix is returned instead.

     The following 'accumarray' example constructs a frequency table that in the first column counts how many occurrences each number in the second column has, taken from the vector X.  Note the usage of 'unique' for assigning to all repeated elements of X the same index (*note unique: XREFunique.).

          X = [91, 92, 90, 92, 90, 89, 91, 89, 90, 100, 100, 100];
          [U, ~, J] = unique (X);
          [accumarray(J', 1), U']
            =>  2    89
                3    90
                2    91
                2    92
                3   100

     Another example, where the result is a multi-dimensional 3-D array and the default value (zero) appears in the output:

          accumarray ([1, 1, 1;
                       2, 1, 2;
                       2, 3, 2;
                       2, 1, 2;
                       2, 3, 2], 101:105)
          => ans(:,:,1) = [101, 0, 0; 0, 0, 0]
          => ans(:,:,2) = [0, 0, 0; 206, 0, 208]

     The sparse option can be used as an alternative to the 'sparse' constructor (*note sparse: XREFsparse.).  Thus

          sparse (I, J, SV)

     can be written with 'accumarray' as

          accumarray ([I, J], SV', [], [], 0, true)

     For repeated indices, 'sparse' adds the corresponding value.  To take the minimum instead, use 'min' as an accumulator function:

          accumarray ([I, J], SV', [], @min, 0, true)

     The complexity of accumarray in general for the non-sparse case is generally O(M+N), where N is the number of subscripts and M is the maximum subscript (linearized in multi-dimensional case).  If FUNC is one of '@sum' (default), '@max', '@min' or '@(x) {x}', an optimized code path is used.  Note that for general reduction function the interpreter overhead can play a major part and it may be more efficient to do multiple accumarray calls and compute the results in a vectorized manner.

 -- Function File: accumdim (SUBS, VALS, DIM, N, FUNC, FILLVAL)
     Create an array by accumulating the slices of an array into the positions defined by their subscripts along a specified dimension.

     The subscripts are defined by the index vector SUBS.  The dimension is specified by DIM.  If not given, it defaults to the first non-singleton dimension.  The length of SUBS must be equal to 'size (VALS, DIM)'.

     The extent of the result matrix in the working dimension will be determined by the subscripts themselves.  However, if N is defined it determines this extent.

     The default action of 'accumdim' is to sum the subarrays with the same subscripts.  This behavior can be modified by defining the FUNC function.  This should be a function or function handle that accepts an array and a dimension, and reduces the array along this dimension.  As a special exception, the built-in 'min' and 'max' functions can be used directly, and 'accumdim' accounts for the middle empty argument that is used in their calling.

     The slices of the returned array that have no subscripts associated with them are set to zero.  Defining FILLVAL to some other value allows these values to be defined.

     An example of the use of 'accumdim' is:

          accumdim ([1, 2, 1, 2, 1], [ 7, -10,   4;
                                      -5, -12,   8;
                                     -12,   2,   8;
                                     -10,   9,  -3;
                                      -5,  -3, -13])
          => [-10,-11,-1;-15,-3,5]

     Circularly shift the values of the array X.

     N must be a vector of integers no longer than the number of dimensions in X.  The values of N can be either positive or negative, which determines the direction in which the values or X are shifted.  If an element of N is zero, then the corresponding dimension of X will not be shifted.  For example:

          x = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6; 7, 8, 9];
          circshift (x, 1)

     Determine if all input arguments are either scalar or of common size.

     If true, ERR is zero, and YI is a matrix of the common size with all entries equal to XI if this is a scalar or XI otherwise.  If the inputs cannot be brought to a common size, ERR is 1, and YI is XI.  For example:

          [errorcode, a, b] = common_size ([1 2; 3 4], 5)
               => errorcode = 0
               => a = [ 1, 2; 3, 4 ]

     Cumulative numerical integration of points Y using the trapezoidal method.

     'cumtrapz (Y)' computes the cumulative integral of Y along the first non-singleton dimension.  Where 'trapz' reports only the overall integral sum, 'cumtrapz' reports the current partial sum value at each point of Y.

     When the argument X is omitted an equally spaced X vector with unit spacing (1) is assumed.  'cumtrapz (X, Y)' evaluates the integral with respect to the spacing in X and the values in Y.  This is useful if the points in Y have been sampled unevenly.

     If the optional DIM argument is given, operate along this dimension.

     Application Note: If X is not specified then unit spacing will be used.  To scale the integral to the correct value you must multiply by the actual spacing value (deltaX).

     Numerically evaluate the double integral of F.

     F is a function handle, inline function, or string containing the name of the function to evaluate.  The function F must have the form z = f(x,y) where X is a vector and Y is a scalar.  It should return a vector of the same length and orientation as X.

     XA, YA and XB, YB are the lower and upper limits of integration for x and y respectively.  The underlying integrator determines whether infinite bounds are accepted.

     The optional argument TOL defines the absolute tolerance used to integrate each sub-integral.  The default value is 1e^{-6}.

     The optional argument QUADF specifies which underlying integrator function to use.  Any choice but 'quad' is available and the default is 'quadcc'.

     Additional arguments, are passed directly to F.  To use the default value for TOL or QUADF one may pass ':' or an empty matrix ([]).

     Copy the input parameters into the corresponding output parameters.

     If only a single input parameter is supplied, its value is copied to each of the outputs.

     For example,

          [a, b, c] = deal (x, y, z);

     is equivalent to

          a = x;
          b = y;
          c = z;

     and

          [a, b, c] = deal (x);

     is equivalent to

          a = b = c = x;

     Programming Note: 'deal' is often used with comma separated lists derived from cell arrays or structures.  This is unnecessary as the interpreter can perform the same action without the overhead of a function call.  For example:

          c = {[1 2], "Three", 4};
          [x, y, z ] = c{:}
          =>
             x =

                1   2

     Calculate the discrete Laplace operator.

     For a 2-dimensional matrix M this is defined as

                1    / d^2            d^2         \
          D  = --- * | ---  M(x,y) +  ---  M(x,y) |
                4    \ dx^2           dy^2        /

     For N-dimensional arrays the sum in parentheses is expanded to include second derivatives over the additional higher dimensions.

     The spacing between evaluation points may be defined by H, which is a scalar defining the equidistant spacing in all dimensions.  Alternatively, the spacing in each dimension may be defined separately by DX, DY, etc.  A scalar spacing argument defines equidistant spacing, whereas a vector argument can be used to specify variable spacing.  The length of the spacing vectors must match the respective dimension of M.  The default spacing value is 1.

     At least 3 data points are needed for each dimension.  Boundary points are calculated from the linear extrapolation of interior points.

     Calculate the gradient of sampled data or a function.

     If M is a vector, calculate the one-dimensional gradient of M.  If M is a matrix the gradient is calculated for each dimension.

     '[DX, DY] = gradient (M)' calculates the one-dimensional gradient for X and Y direction if M is a matrix.  Additional return arguments can be use for multi-dimensional matrices.

     A constant spacing between two points can be provided by the S parameter.  If S is a scalar, it is assumed to be the spacing for all dimensions.  Otherwise, separate values of the spacing can be supplied by the X, ... arguments.  Scalar values specify an equidistant spacing.  Vector values for the X, ... arguments specify the coordinate for that dimension.  The length must match their respective dimension of M.

     At boundary points a linear extrapolation is applied.  Interior points are calculated with the first approximation of the numerical gradient

          y'(i) = 1/(x(i+1)-x(i-1)) * (y(i-1)-y(i+1)).

     If the first argument F is a function handle, the gradient of the function at the points in X0 is approximated using central difference.  For example, 'gradient (@cos, 0)' approximates the gradient of the cosine function in the point x0 = 0.  As with sampled data, the spacing values between the points from which the gradient is estimated can be set via the S or DX, DY, ... arguments.  By default a spacing of 1 is used.

 -- Function File: idivide (X, Y, OP)
     Integer division with different rounding rules.

     The standard behavior of integer division such as 'A ./ B' is to round the result to the nearest integer.  This is not always the desired behavior and 'idivide' permits integer element-by-element division to be performed with different treatment for the fractional part of the division as determined by the OP flag.  OP is a string with one of the values:

     "fix"
          Calculate 'A ./ B' with the fractional part rounded towards zero.

     "round"
          Calculate 'A ./ B' with the fractional part rounded towards the nearest integer.

     "floor"
          Calculate 'A ./ B' with the fractional part rounded towards negative infinity.

     "ceil"
          Calculate 'A ./ B' with the fractional part rounded towards positive infinity.

     If OP is not given it defaults to "fix".  An example demonstrating these rounding rules is

          idivide (int8 ([-3, 3]), int8 (4), "fix")
            => int8 ([0, 0])
          idivide (int8 ([-3, 3]), int8 (4), "round")
            => int8 ([-1, 1])
          idivide (int8 ([-3, 3]), int8 (4), "floor")
            => int8 ([-1, 0])
          idivide (int8 ([-3, 3]), int8 (4), "ceil")

 -- Function File: P = inputParser ()
     Create object P of the inputParser class.

     This class is designed to allow easy parsing of function arguments.  The class supports four types of arguments:

       1. mandatory (see 'addRequired');

       2. optional (see 'addOptional');

       3. named (see 'addParamValue');

       4. switch (see 'addSwitch').

     After defining the function API with these methods, the supplied arguments can be parsed with the 'parse' method and the parsing results accessed with the 'Results' accessor.

 -- Accessor method: inputParser.Parameters
     Return list of parameter names already defined.

 -- Accessor method: inputParser.Results
     Return structure with argument names as fieldnames and corresponding values.

 -- Accessor method: inputParser.Unmatched
     Return structure similar to 'Results', but for unmatched parameters.  See the 'KeepUnmatched' property.

 -- Accessor method: inputParser.UsingDefaults
     Return cell array with the names of arguments that are using default values.

 -- Class property: inputParser.CaseSensitive = BOOLEAN
     Set whether matching of argument names should be case sensitive.  Defaults to false.

 -- Class property: inputParser.FunctionName = NAME
     Set function name to be used in error messages; Defaults to empty string.

 -- Class property: inputParser.KeepUnmatched = BOOLEAN
     Set whether an error should be given for non-defined arguments.  Defaults to false.  If set to true, the extra arguments can be accessed through 'Unmatched' after the 'parse' method.  Note that since 'Switch' and 'ParamValue' arguments can be mixed, it is not possible to know the unmatched type.  If argument is found unmatched it is assumed to be of the 'ParamValue' type and it is expected to be followed by a value.

 -- Class property: inputParser.StructExpand = BOOLEAN
     Set whether a structure can be passed to the function instead of parameter/value pairs.  Defaults to true.  Not implemented yet.

     The following example shows how to use this class:

          function check (varargin)
            p = inputParser ();                      # create object
            p.FunctionName = "check";                # set function name
            p.addRequired ("pack", @ischar);         # mandatory argument
            p.addOptional ("path", pwd(), @ischar);  # optional argument

            ## create a function handle to anonymous functions for validators
            val_mat = @(x) isvector (x) && all (x <= 1) && all (x >= 0);
            p.addOptional ("mat", [0 0], val_mat);

            ## create two arguments of type "ParamValue"
            val_type = @(x) any (strcmp (x, {"linear", "quadratic"}));
            p.addParamValue ("type", "linear", val_type);
            val_verb = @(x) any (strcmp (x, {"low", "medium", "high"}));
            p.addParamValue ("tolerance", "low", val_verb);

            ## create a switch type of argument
            p.addSwitch ("verbose");

            p.parse (varargin{:});  # Run created parser on inputs

            ## the rest of the function can access inputs by using p.Results.
            ## for example, get the tolerance input with p.Results.tolerance
          endfunction

          check ("mech");           # valid, use defaults for other arguments
          check ();                 # error, one argument is mandatory
          check (1);                # error, since ! ischar
          check ("mech", "~/dev");  # valid, use defaults for other arguments

          check ("mech", "~/dev", [0 1 0 0], "type", "linear");  # valid

          ## following is also valid.  Note how the Switch argument type can
          ## be mixed into or before the ParamValue argument type (but it
          ## must still appear after any Optional argument).
          check ("mech", "~/dev", [0 1 0 0], "verbose", "tolerance", "high");

          ## following returns an error since not all optional arguments,
          ## `path' and `mat', were given before the named argument `type'.
          check ("mech", "~/dev", "type", "linear");

     _Note 1_: A function can have any mixture of the four API types but they must appear in a specific order.  'Required' arguments must be first and can be followed by any 'Optional' arguments.  Only the 'ParamValue' and 'Switch' arguments may be mixed together and they must appear at the end.

     _Note 2_: If both 'Optional' and 'ParamValue' arguments are mixed in a function API then once a string Optional argument fails to validate it will be considered the end of the 'Optional' arguments.  The remaining arguments will be compared against any 'ParamValue' or 'Switch' arguments.

     One-dimensional interpolation.

     Interpolate input data to determine the value of YI at the points XI.  If not specified, X is taken to be the indices of Y ('1:length (Y)').  If Y is a matrix or an N-dimensional array, the interpolation is performed on each column of Y.

     The interpolation METHOD is one of:

     "nearest"
          Return the nearest neighbor.

     "previous"
          Return the previous neighbor.

     "next"
          Return the next neighbor.

     "linear" (default)
          Linear interpolation from nearest neighbors.

     "pchip"
          Piecewise cubic Hermite interpolating polynomial--shape-preserving interpolation with smooth first derivative.

     "cubic"
          Cubic interpolation (same as "pchip").

     "spline"
          Cubic spline interpolation--smooth first and second derivatives throughout the curve.

     Adding '*' to the start of any method above forces 'interp1' to assume that X is uniformly spaced, and only 'X(1)' and 'X(2)' are referenced.  This is usually faster, and is never slower.  The default method is "linear".

     If EXTRAP is the string "extrap", then extrapolate values beyond the endpoints using the current METHOD.  If EXTRAP is a number, then replace values beyond the endpoints with that number.  When unspecified, EXTRAP defaults to 'NA'.

     If the string argument "pp" is specified, then XI should not be supplied and 'interp1' returns a piecewise polynomial object.  This object can later be used with 'ppval' to evaluate the interpolation.  There is an equivalence, such that 'ppval (interp1 (X, Y, METHOD, "pp"), XI) == interp1 (X, Y, XI, METHOD, "extrap")'.

     Duplicate points in X specify a discontinuous interpolant.  There may be at most 2 consecutive points with the same value.  If X is increasing, the default discontinuous interpolant is right-continuous.  If X is decreasing, the default discontinuous interpolant is left-continuous.  The continuity condition of the interpolant may be specified by using the options "left" or "right" to select a left-continuous or right-continuous interpolant, respectively.  Discontinuous interpolation is only allowed for "nearest" and "linear" methods; in all other cases, the X-values must be unique.

     An example of the use of 'interp1' is

          xf = [0:0.05:10];
          yf = sin (2*pi*xf/5);
          xp = [0:10];
          yp = sin (2*pi*xp/5);
          lin = interp1 (xp, yp, xf);
          near = interp1 (xp, yp, xf, "nearest");
          pch = interp1 (xp, yp, xf, "pchip");
          spl = interp1 (xp, yp, xf, "spline");
          plot (xf,yf,"r", xf,near,"g", xf,lin,"b", xf,pch,"c", xf,spl,"m",
                xp,yp,"r*");
          legend ("original", "nearest", "linear", "pchip", "spline");

     Two-dimensional interpolation.

     Interpolate reference data X, Y, Z to determine ZI at the coordinates XI, YI.  The reference data X, Y can be matrices, as returned by 'meshgrid', in which case the sizes of X, Y, and Z must be equal.  If X, Y are vectors describing a grid then 'length (X) == columns (Z)' and 'length (Y) == rows (Z)'.  In either case the input data must be strictly monotonic.

     If called without X, Y, and just a single reference data matrix Z, the 2-D region 'X = 1:columns (Z), Y = 1:rows (Z)' is assumed.  This saves memory if the grid is regular and the distance between points is not important.

     If called with a single reference data matrix Z and a refinement value N, then perform interpolation over a grid where each original interval has been recursively subdivided N times.  This results in '2^N-1' additional points for every interval in the original grid.  If N is omitted a value of 1 is used.  As an example, the interval [0,1] with 'N==2' results in a refined interval with points at [0, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, 1].

     The interpolation METHOD is one of:

     "nearest"
          Return the nearest neighbor.

     "linear" (default)
          Linear interpolation from nearest neighbors.

     EXTRAP is a scalar number.  It replaces values beyond the endpoints with EXTRAP.  Note that if EXTRAPVAL is used, METHOD must be specified as well.  If EXTRAP is omitted and the METHOD is "spline", then the extrapolated values of the "spline" are used.  Otherwise the default EXTRAP value for any other METHOD is "NA".

     Three-dimensional interpolation.

     Interpolate reference data X, Y, Z, V to determine VI at the coordinates XI, YI, ZI.  The reference data X, Y, Z can be matrices, as returned by 'meshgrid', in which case the sizes of X, Y, Z, and V must be equal.  If X, Y, Z are vectors describing a cubic grid then 'length (X) == columns (V)', 'length (Y) == rows (V)', and 'length (Z) == size (V, 3)'.  In either case the input data must be strictly monotonic.

     If called without X, Y, Z, and just a single reference data matrix V, the 3-D region 'X = 1:columns (V), Y = 1:rows (V), Z = 1:size (V, 3)' is assumed.  This saves memory if the grid is regular and the distance between points is not important.

     If called with a single reference data matrix V and a refinement value N, then perform interpolation over a 3-D grid where each original interval has been recursively subdivided N times.  This results in '2^N-1' additional points for every interval in the original grid.  If N is omitted a value of 1 is used.

     Fourier interpolation.

     If X is a vector then X is resampled with N points.  The data in X is assumed to be equispaced.  If X is a matrix or an N-dimensional array, the interpolation is performed on each column of X.

     If DIM is specified, then interpolate along the dimension DIM.

     'interpft' assumes that the interpolated function is periodic, and so assumptions are made about the endpoints of the interpolation.

     Perform N-dimensional interpolation, where N is at least two.

     Each element of the N-dimensional array V represents a value at a location given by the parameters X1, X2, ..., XN.  The parameters X1, X2, ..., XN are either N-dimensional arrays of the same size as the array V in the "ndgrid" format or vectors.  The parameters Y1, etc.  respect a similar format to X1, etc., and they represent the points at which the array VI is interpolated.

     If X1, ..., XN are omitted, they are assumed to be 'x1 = 1 : size (V, 1)', etc.  If M is specified, then the interpolation adds a point half way between each of the interpolation points.  This process is performed M times.  If only V is specified, then M is assumed to be '1'.

     Return the Nth output argument of the function specified by the function handle or string FUNC.

     Any additional arguments are passed directly to FUNC.  The total number of arguments to call FUNC with can be passed in NTOT; by default NTOT is N.  The input N can also be a vector of indices of the output, in which case the output will be a cell array of the requested output arguments.

     The intended use 'nthargout' is to avoid intermediate variables.  For example, when finding the indices of the maximum entry of a matrix, the following two compositions of nthargout

          M = magic (5);
          cell2mat (nthargout ([1, 2], @ind2sub, size (M),
                               nthargout (2, @max, M(:))))
          => 5   3

     are completely equivalent to the following lines:

          M = magic (5);
          [~, idx] = max (M(:));
          [i, j] = ind2sub (size (M), idx);
          [i, j]
          => 5   3

     It can also be helpful to have all output arguments in a single cell in the following manner:

          USV = nthargout ([1:3], @svd, hilb (5));

     Notes:

     For MATLAB compatibility, leading spaces are stripped before returning the string.

     The 'num2str' function is not very flexible.  For better control over the results, use 'sprintf' (*note Formatted Output::).

     For complex X, the format string may only contain one output conversion specification and nothing else.  Otherwise, results will be unpredictable.

     Transform polar or cylindrical coordinates to Cartesian coordinates.

     The inputs THETA, R, (and Z) must be the same shape, or scalar.  If called with a single matrix argument then each row of P represents the polar/(cylindrical) coordinate (THETA, R (, Z)).

     THETA describes the angle relative to the positive x-axis.

     R is the distance to the z-axis (0, 0, z).

     If only a single return argument is requested then return a matrix C where each row represents one Cartesian coordinate (X, Y (, Z)).

     Determine area of a polygon by triangle method.

     The variables X and Y define the vertex pairs, and must therefore have the same shape.  They can be either vectors or arrays.  If they are arrays then the columns of X and Y are treated separately and an area returned for each.

     If the optional DIM argument is given, then 'polyarea' works along this dimension of the arrays X and Y.

 -- Function File: Q = quadgk (F, A, B, PROP, VAL, ...)
 -- Function File: [Q, ERR] = quadgk (...)

     Numerically evaluate the integral of F from A to B using adaptive Gauss-Konrod quadrature.

     F is a function handle, inline function, or string containing the name of the function to evaluate.  The function F must be vectorized and return a vector of output values when given a vector of input values.

     A and B are the lower and upper limits of integration.  Either or both limits may be infinite or contain weak end singularities.  Variable transformation will be used to treat any infinite intervals and weaken the singularities.  For example:

          quadgk (@(x) 1 ./ (sqrt (x) .* (x + 1)), 0, Inf)

     Note that the formulation of the integrand uses the element-by-element operator './' and all user functions to 'quadgk' should do the same.

     The optional argument TOL defines the absolute tolerance used to stop the integration procedure.  The default value is 1e-10.

     The algorithm used by 'quadgk' involves subdividing the integration interval and evaluating each subinterval.  If TRACE is true then after computing each of these partial integrals display: (1) the number of subintervals at this step, (2) the current estimate of the error ERR, (3) the current estimate for the integral Q.

     Alternatively, properties of 'quadgk' can be passed to the function as pairs "PROP", VAL.  Valid properties are

     'AbsTol'
          Define the absolute error tolerance for the quadrature.  The default absolute tolerance is 1e-10.

     'RelTol'
          Define the relative error tolerance for the quadrature.  The default relative tolerance is 1e-5.

     'MaxIntervalCount'
          'quadgk' initially subdivides the interval on which to perform the quadrature into 10 intervals.  Subintervals that have an unacceptable error are subdivided and re-evaluated.  If the number of subintervals exceeds 650 subintervals at any point then a poor convergence is signaled and the current estimate of the integral is returned.  The property "MaxIntervalCount" can be used to alter the number of subintervals that can exist before exiting.

     'WayPoints'
          Discontinuities in the first derivative of the function to integrate can be flagged with the "WayPoints" property.  This forces the ends of a subinterval to fall on the breakpoints of the function and can result in significantly improved estimation of the error in the integral, faster computation, or both.  For example,

               quadgk (@(x) abs (1 - x.^2), 0, 2, "Waypoints", 1)

          signals the breakpoint in the integrand at 'X = 1'.

     'Trace'
          If logically true 'quadgk' prints information on the convergence of the quadrature at each iteration.

     If any of A, B, or WAYPOINTS is complex then the quadrature is treated as a contour integral along a piecewise continuous path defined by the above.  In this case the integral is assumed to have no edge singularities.  For example,

          quadgk (@(z) log (z), 1+1i, 1+1i, "WayPoints",
                  [1-1i, -1,-1i, -1+1i])

     integrates 'log (z)' along the square defined by '[1+1i, 1-1i, -1-1i, -1+1i]'.

     The result of the integration is returned in Q.

     ERR is an approximate bound on the error in the integral 'abs (Q - I)', where I is the exact value of the integral.

     Numerically evaluate the integral of F from A to B using an adaptive Simpson's rule.

     F is a function handle, inline function, or string containing the name of the function to evaluate.  'quadv' is a vectorized version of 'quad' and the function defined by F must accept a scalar or vector as input and return a scalar, vector, or array as output.

     A and B are the lower and upper limits of integration.  Both limits must be finite.

     The optional argument TOL defines the absolute tolerance used to stop the adaptation procedure.  The default value is 1e-6.

     The algorithm used by 'quadv' involves recursively subdividing the integration interval and applying Simpson's rule on each subinterval.  If TRACE is true then after computing each of these partial integrals display: (1) the total number of function evaluations, (2) the left end of the subinterval, (3) the length of the subinterval, (4) the approximation of the integral over the subinterval.

     Additional arguments P1, etc., are passed directly to the function F.  To use default values for TOL and TRACE, one may pass empty matrices ([]).

     The result of the integration is returned in Q

     NFUN indicates the number of function evaluations that were made.

     Note: 'quadv' is written in Octave's scripting language and can be used recursively in 'dblquad' and 'triplequad', unlike the 'quad' function.

     Return random integers in the range 1:IMAX.

     Additional arguments determine the shape of the return matrix.  When no arguments are specified a single random integer is returned.  If one argument N is specified then a square matrix (N x N) is returned.  Two or more arguments will return a multi-dimensional matrix (M x N x ...).

     The integer range may optionally be described by a two element matrix with a lower and upper bound in which case the returned integers will be on the interval [IMIN, IMAX].

     The optional argument CLASS will return a matrix of the requested type.  The default is "double".

     The following example returns 150 integers in the range 1-10.

          ri = randi (10, 150, 1)

     Implementation Note: 'randi' relies internally on 'rand' which uses class "double" to represent numbers.  This limits the maximum integer (IMAX) and range (IMAX - IMIN) to the value returned by the 'flintmax' function.  For IEEE floating point numbers this value is 2^{53} - 1.

 -- Function File: Y = shiftdim (X, N)

     Shift the dimensions of X by N, where N must be an integer scalar.

     When N is positive, the dimensions of X are shifted to the left, with the leading dimensions circulated to the end.  If N is negative, then the dimensions of X are shifted to the right, with N leading singleton dimensions added.

     Called with a single argument, 'shiftdim', removes the leading singleton dimensions, returning the number of dimensions removed in the second output argument NS.

     For example:

          x = ones (1, 2, 3);
          size (shiftdim (x, -1))
             => [1, 1, 2, 3]

     Transform spherical coordinates to Cartesian coordinates.

     The inputs THETA, PHI, and R must be the same shape, or scalar.  If called with a single matrix argument then each row of S represents the spherical coordinate (THETA, PHI, R).

     THETA describes the angle relative to the positive x-axis.

     PHI is the angle relative to the xy-plane.

     R is the distance to the origin (0, 0, 0).

     If only a single return argument is requested then return a matrix C where each row represents one Cartesian coordinate (X, Y, Z).

 -- Function File: structfun (FUNC, S)
 -- Function File: [A, ...] = structfun (...)
 -- Function File: structfun (..., "ErrorHandler", ERRFUNC)
 -- Function File: structfun (..., "UniformOutput", VAL)

     Evaluate the function named NAME on the fields of the structure S.  The fields of S are passed to the function FUNC individually.

     'structfun' accepts an arbitrary function FUNC in the form of an inline function, function handle, or the name of a function (in a character string).  In the case of a character string argument, the function must accept a single argument named X, and it must return a string value.  If the function returns more than one argument, they are returned as separate output variables.

     If the parameter "UniformOutput" is set to true (the default), then the function must return a single element which will be concatenated into the return value.  If "UniformOutput" is false, the outputs are placed into a structure with the same fieldnames as the input structure.

          s.name1 = "John Smith";
          s.name2 = "Jill Jones";
          structfun (@(x) regexp (x, '(\w+)$', "matches"){1}, s,
                     "UniformOutput", false)
          =>
             {
               name1 = Smith
               name2 = Jones
             }

     Given the parameter "ErrorHandler", ERRFUNC defines a function to call in case FUNC generates an error.  The form of the function is

          function [...] = errfunc (SE, ...)

     where there is an additional input argument to ERRFUNC relative to FUNC, given by SE.  This is a structure with the elements "identifier", "message" and "index", giving respectively the error identifier, the error message, and the index into the input arguments of the element that caused the error.  For an example on how to use an error handler, *note cellfun: XREFcellfun.

 -- Function File: IDX = subsindex (A)
     Convert an object to an index vector.

     When A is a class object defined with a class constructor, then 'subsindex' is the overloading method that allows the conversion of this class object to a valid indexing vector.  It is important to note that 'subsindex' must return a zero-based real integer vector of the class "double".  For example, if the class constructor

          function b = myclass (a)
            b = class (struct ("a", a), "myclass");
          endfunction

     then the 'subsindex' function

          function idx = subsindex (a)
            idx = double (a.a) - 1.0;
          endfunction

     can then be used as follows

          a = myclass (1:4);
          b = 1:10;
          b(a)
          => 1  2  3  4

 -- Function File: Q = trapz (Y)
 -- Function File: Q = trapz (X, Y)
 -- Function File: Q = trapz (..., DIM)

     Numerically evaluate the integral of points Y using the trapezoidal method.

     'trapz (Y)' computes the integral of Y along the first non-singleton dimension.  When the argument X is omitted an equally spaced X vector with unit spacing (1) is assumed.  'trapz (X, Y)' evaluates the integral with respect to the spacing in X and the values in Y.  This is useful if the points in Y have been sampled unevenly.

     If the optional DIM argument is given, operate along this dimension.

     Application Note: If X is not specified then unit spacing will be used.  To scale the integral to the correct value you must multiply by the actual spacing value (deltaX). As an example, the integral of x^3 over the range [0, 1] is x^4/4 or 0.25.  The following code uses 'trapz' to calculate the integral in three different ways.

          x = 0:0.1:1;
          y = x.^3;
          q = trapz (y)
            => q = 2.525   # No scaling
          q * 0.1
            => q = 0.2525  # Approximation to integral by scaling
          trapz (x, y)
            => q = 0.2525  # Same result by specifying X

     Numerically evaluate the triple integral of F.

     F is a function handle, inline function, or string containing the name of the function to evaluate.  The function F must have the form w = f(x,y,z) where either X or Y is a vector and the remaining inputs are scalars.  It should return a vector of the same length and orientation as X or Y.

     XA, YA, ZA and XB, YB, ZB are the lower and upper limits of integration for x, y, and z respectively.  The underlying integrator determines whether infinite bounds are accepted.

     The optional argument TOL defines the absolute tolerance used to integrate each sub-integral.  The default value is 1e-6.

     The optional argument QUADF specifies which underlying integrator function to use.  Any choice but 'quad' is available and the default is 'quadcc'.

     Additional arguments, are passed directly to F.  To use the default value for TOL or QUADF one may pass ':' or an empty matrix ([]).

The error message can be made further complete by the function name FUN_NAME, the argument name ARG_NAME, and its position in the input ARG_IDX.

     CLASSES must be a cell array of strings (an empty cell array is allowed) with the name of classes (remember that a class name is case sensitive).  In addition to the class name, the following categories names are also valid:

     "float"
          Floating point value comprising classes "double" and "single".

     "size"
          Its size has length equal to the values of the next in ATTRIBUTES.  The next value must is an array with the length for each dimension.  To ignore the check for a certain dimension, the value of 'NaN' can be used.

     "square"

     Compute the Delaunay triangulation for an N-dimensional set of points.

     The Delaunay triangulation is a tessellation of the convex hull of a set of points such that no N-sphere defined by the N-triangles contains any other points from the set.

     The input matrix PTS of size [n, dim] contains n points in a space of dimension dim.  The return matrix T has size [m, dim+1].  Each row of T contains a set of indices back into the original set of points PTS which describes a simplex of dimension dim.  For example, a 2-D simplex is a triangle and 3-D simplex is a tetrahedron.

     Compute the Delaunay triangulation for a 2-D or 3-D set of points.

     For 2-D sets, the return value TRI is a set of triangles which satisfies the Delaunay circum-circle criterion, i.e., only a single data point from [X, Y] is within the circum-circle of the defining triangle.  The set of triangles TRI is a matrix of size [n, 3].  Each row defines a triangle and the three columns are the three vertices of the triangle.  The value of 'TRI(i,j)' is an index into X and Y for the location of the j-th vertex of the i-th triangle.

     For 3-D sets, the return value TETR is a set of tetrahedrons which satisfies the Delaunay circum-circle criterion, i.e., only a single data point from [X, Y, Z] is within the circum-circle of the defining tetrahedron.  The set of tetrahedrons is a matrix of size [n, 4].  Each row defines a tetrahedron and the four columns are the four vertices of the tetrahedron.  The value of 'TETR(i,j)' is an index into X, Y, Z for the location of the j-th vertex of the i-th tetrahedron.

     The input X may also be a matrix with two or three columns where the first column contains x-data, the second y-data, and the optional third column contains z-data.

     2-dimensional rectangles are defined as '[xpos ypos width height]' where xpos and ypos are the position of the bottom left corner.  Higher dimensions are supported where the coordinates for the minimum value of each dimension follow the length of the box in that dimension, e.g., '[xpos ypos zpos kpos ... width height depth k_length ...]'.

     Each row of A and B define a rectangle, and if both define multiple rectangles, then the output, AREA, is a matrix where the i-th row corresponds to the i-th row of a and the j-th column corresponds to the j-th row of b.

     Plot the Voronoi diagram of points '(X, Y)'.

     The Voronoi facets with points at infinity are not drawn.

     The OPTIONS argument, which must be a string or cell array of strings, contains options passed to the underlying qhull command.  See the documentation for the Qhull library for details <http://www.qhull.org/html/qh-quick.htm#options>.

     If "linespec" is given it is used to set the color and line style of the plot.

     If an axis graphics handle HAX is supplied then the Voronoi diagram is drawn on the specified axis rather than in a new figure.

     If a single output argument is requested then the Voronoi diagram will be plotted and a graphics handle H to the plot is returned.

     [VX, VY] = voronoi (...) returns the Voronoi vertices instead of plotting the diagram.

          x = rand (10, 1);
          y = rand (size (x));
          h = convhull (x, y);

 -- Function File: [C, F] = voronoin (PTS)
 -- Function File: [C, F] = voronoin (PTS, OPTIONS)
     Compute N-dimensional Voronoi facets.

     The input matrix PTS of size [n, dim] contains n points in a space of dimension dim.

     C contains the points of the Voronoi facets.  The list F contains, for each facet, the indices of the Voronoi points.

     An optional second argument, which must be a string or cell array of strings, contains options passed to the underlying qhull command.  See the documentation for the Qhull library for details <http://www.qhull.org/html/qh-quick.htm#options>.

     The default options depend on the dimension of the input:

        * 2-D and 3-D: OPTIONS = '{"Qbb"}'

        * 4-D and higher: OPTIONS = '{"Qbb", "Qx"}'

     If OPTIONS is not present or '[]' then the default arguments are used.  Otherwise, OPTIONS replaces the default argument list.  To append user options to the defaults it is necessary to repeat the default arguments in OPTIONS.  Use a null string to pass no arguments.

     Create a uicontrol object and return a handle to it.

     uicontrols are used to create simple interactive controls such as push buttons, checkboxes, edit and list controls.

     If PARENT is omitted then a uicontrol for the current figure is created.  If no figure is available, a new figure is created first.

     If PARENT is given then a uicontrol relative to PARENT is created.

     Any provided property value pairs will override the default values of the created uicontrol object.

     Control of the type of uicontrol created is through the use of the STYLE property.  If no style property is provided, a push button will be created.

     Valid styles for uicontrol are:

     "checkbox"
          Create a checkbox control that allows user on/off selection.

     "edit"
          Create a edit control that allows user input of single or multiple lines of text.

     "listbox"
          Create a listbox control that displays a lit of items and allows user slelection of single or multiple items.

     "popupmenu"
          Create a popupmenu control that displays a list of options that can be selected when the user clicks on the control.

     "pushbutton"
          Create a push button control that allows user to press to cause an action.

     "radiobutton"
          Create a radio button control intended to be used for mutually exclusive input in a group of of radiobutton controls.

     "slider"
          Create a slider control that allows user selection from a range of values by sliding knob on the control.

     "text"
          Create a static text control to display single or multiple lines of text.

     "togglebutton"
          Create a toggle button control that appears like a push button but allows the user to select between two states.

     Examples:

          % create figure and panel on it
          f = figure;
          % create a button (default style)
          b1 = uicontrol (f, "string", "A Button", "position",[10 10 150 40]);

     Open a GUI dialog for selecting a file and return the filename FNAME, the path to this file FPATH, and the filter index FLTIDX.

     FLT contains a (list of) file filter string(s) in one of the following formats:

     "/path/to/filename.ext"
          If a filename is given then the file extension is extracted and used as filter.  In addition, the path is selected as current path and the filename is selected as default file.  Example: 'uigetfile ("myfun.m")'

     A single file extension "*.ext"
          Example: 'uigetfile ("*.ext")'

     A 2-column cell array
          containing a file extension in the first column and a brief description in the second column.  Example: 'uigetfile ({"*.ext", "My Description";"*.xyz", "XYZ-Format"})'

          The filter string can also contain a semicolon separated list of filter extensions.  Example: 'uigetfile ({"*.gif;*.png;*.jpg", "Supported Picture Formats"})'

     DIALOG_NAME can be used to customize the dialog title.

     If DEFAULT_FILE is given then it will be selected in the GUI dialog.  If, in addition, a path is given it is also used as current path.

     The screen position of the GUI dialog can be set using the "Position" key and a 2-element vector containing the pixel coordinates.  Two or more files can be selected when setting the "MultiSelect" key to "on".  In that case FNAME is a cell array containing the files.

     Create a uimenu object and return a handle to it.

     If H is omitted then a top-level menu for the current figure is created.  If H is given then a submenu relative to H is created.

     uimenu objects have the following specific properties:

     "accelerator"
          A string containing the key combination together with CTRL to execute this menu entry (e.g., "x" for CTRL+x).

     "callback"
          Is the function called when this menu entry is executed.  It can be either a function string (e.g., "myfun"), a function handle (e.g., @myfun) or a cell array containing the function handle and arguments for the callback function (e.g., {@myfun, arg1, arg2}).

     "checked"
          Can be set "on" or "off".  Sets a mark at this menu entry.

     "enable"
          Can be set "on" or "off".  If disabled the menu entry cannot be selected and it is grayed out.

     "foregroundcolor"
          A color value setting the text color for this menu entry.

     "label"
          A string containing the label for this menu entry.  A "&"-symbol can be used to mark the "accelerator" character (e.g., "E&xit")

     "position"
          An scalar value containing the relative menu position.  The entry with the lowest value is at the first position starting from left or top.

     "separator"
          Can be set "on" or "off".  If enabled it draws a separator line above the current position.  It is ignored for top level entries.

     Examples:

          f = uimenu ("label", "&File", "accelerator", "f");
          e = uimenu ("label", "&Edit", "accelerator", "e");
          uimenu (f, "label", "Close", "accelerator", "q", ...

     uipanels are used as containers to group other uicontrol objects.

     If PARENT is omitted then a uipanel for the current figure is created.  If no figure is available, a new figure is created first.

     If PARENT is given then a uipanel relative to PARENT is created.

     Any provided property value pairs will override the default values of the created uipanel object.

     Examples:

     Create a uipushtool object and return a handle to it.

     uipushtools are buttons that appear on a figure toolbar.  The button is created with a border that is shown when the user hovers over the button.  An image can be set using the cdata property.

     If PARENT is omitted then a uipushtool for the current figure is created.  If no figure is available, a new figure is created first.  If a figure is available, but does not contain a uitoolbar, a uitoolbar will be created.

     If PARENT is given then a uipushtools is created on the PARENT uitoolbar.

     Any provided property value pairs will override the default values of the created uipushtool object.

     Examples:

          % create figure without a default toolbar
          f = figure ("toolbar", "none");
          % create empty toolbar
          t = uitoolbar (f);
          % create a 19x19x3 black square
          img=zeros(19,19,3);
          % add pushtool button to toolbar
          b = uipushtool (t, "cdata", img);

     Open a GUI dialog for selecting a file.

     FLT contains a (list of) file filter string(s) in one of the following formats:

     "/path/to/filename.ext"
          If a filename is given the file extension is extracted and used as filter.  In addition the path is selected as current path and the filename is selected as default file.  Example: 'uiputfile ("myfun.m")'

     "*.ext"
          A single file extension.  Example: 'uiputfile ("*.ext")'

     '{"*.ext", "My Description"}'
          A 2-column cell array containing the file extension in the 1st column and a brief description in the 2nd column.  Example: 'uiputfile ({"*.ext","My Description";"*.xyz", "XYZ-Format"})'

     The filter string can also contain a semicolon separated list of filter extensions.  Example: 'uiputfile ({"*.gif;*.png;*.jpg", "Supported Picture Formats"})'

     DIALOG_NAME can be used to customize the dialog title.  If DEFAULT_FILE is given it is preselected in the GUI dialog.  If, in addition, a path is given it is also used as current path.

     Suspend program execution until the figure with handle H is deleted or 'uiresume' is called.

     When no figure handle is specified this function uses the current figure.  If the figure handle is invalid or there is no current figure, this functions returns immediately.

     When specified, TIMEOUT defines the number of seconds to wait for the figure deletion or the 'uiresume' call.  The timeout value must be at least 1.  If a smaller value is specified, a warning is issued and a timeout value of 1 is used instead.  If a non-integer value is specified, it is truncated towards 0.  If TIMEOUT is not specified, the program execution is suspended indefinitely.

 -- Function File: [FCN, HELP1STR] = lookfor ("-all", STR)
     Search for the string STR in the documentation of all functions in the current function search path.

     By default, 'lookfor' looks for STR in just the first sentence of the help string for each function found.  The entire help text of each function can be searched by using the "-all" argument.  All searches are case insensitive.

     When called with no output arguments, 'lookfor' prints the list of matching functions to the terminal.  Otherwise, the output argument FCNS contains the function names and HELP1STR contains the first sentence from the help string of each function.

     Programming Note: The ability of 'lookfor' to correctly identify the first sentence of the help text is dependent on the format of the function's help.  All Octave core functions are correctly formatted, but the same can not be guaranteed for external packages and user-supplied functions.  Therefore, the use of the "-all" argument may be necessary to find related functions that are not a part of Octave.

     The speed of lookup is greatly enhanced by having a cached documentation file.  See 'doc_cache_create' for more information.

 -- Function File: [Y, NEWMAP] = cmunique (X, MAP)

 -- Function File: [Y, NEWMAP] = cmunique (I)
     Convert an input image X to an ouput indexed image Y which uses the smallest colormap possible NEWMAP.

     When the input is an indexed image (X with colormap MAP) the output is a colormap NEWMAP from which any repeated rows have been eliminated.  The output image, Y, is the original input image with the indices adjusted to match the new, possibly smaller, colormap.

     When the input is an RGB image (an MxNx3 array), the output colormap will contain one entry for every unique color in the original image.  In the worst case the new map could have as many rows as the number of pixels in the original image.

     When the input is a grayscale image I, the output colormap will contain one entry for every unique intensity value in the original image.  In the worst case the new map could have as many rows as the number of pixels in the original image.

     Implementation Details:

     NEWMAP is always an Mx3 matrix, even if the input image is an intensity grayscale image I (all three RGB planes are assigned the same value).

     The output image is of class uint8 if the size of the new colormap is less than or equal to 256.  Otherwise, the output image is of class double.

     'colormap (MAP)' sets the current colormap to MAP.  The colormap should be an N row by 3 column matrix.  The columns contain red, green, and blue intensities respectively.  All entries must be between 0 and 1 inclusive.  The new colormap is returned.

     'colormap ("default")' restores the default colormap (the 'jet' map with 64 entries).  The default colormap is returned.

     The map may also be specified by a string, "MAP_NAME", where MAP_NAME is the name of a function that returns a colormap.

     If the first argument HAX is an axes handle, then the colormap for the parent figure of HAX is queried or set.

     For convenience, it is also possible to use this function with the command form, 'colormap MAP_NAME'.

     'colormap ("list")' returns a cell array with all of the available colormaps.  The options "register" and "unregister" add or remove the colormap NAME from this list.

     Display a matrix as an indexed color image.

     The elements of IMG are indices into the current colormap.

     X and Y are optional 2-element vectors, '[min, max]', which specify the range for the axis labels.  If a range is specified as '[max, min]' then the image will be reversed along that axis.  For convenience, X and Y may be specified as N-element vectors matching the length of the data in IMG.  However, only the first and last elements will be used to determine the axis limits.  *Warning:* X and Y are ignored when using gnuplot 4.0 or earlier.

     Multiple property/value pairs may be specified for the image object, but they must appear in pairs.

     The optional return value H is a graphics handle to the image.

     Implementation Note: The origin (0, 0) for images is located in the upper left.  For ordinary plots, the origin is located in the lower left.  Octave handles this inversion by plotting the data normally, and then reversing the direction of the y-axis by setting the 'ydir' property to "reverse".  This has implications whenever an image and an ordinary plot need to be overlaid.  The recommended solution is to display the image and then plot the reversed ydata using, for example, 'flipud (ydata)'.

     Calling Forms: The 'image' function can be called in two forms: High-Level and Low-Level.  When invoked with normal options, the High-Level form is used which first calls 'newplot' to prepare the graphic figure and axes.  When the only inputs to 'image' are property/value pairs the Low-Level form is used which creates a new instance of an image object and inserts it in the current axes.

     The colormap is scaled so that the entries of the matrix occupy the entire colormap.  If 'CLIMITS = [LO, HI]' is given, then that range is set to the "clim" of the current axes.

     The axis values corresponding to the matrix elements are specified in X and Y, either as pairs giving the minimum and maximum values for the respective axes, or as values for each row and column of the matrix IMG.

     The optional return value H is a graphics handle to the image.

     Manage supported image formats.

     FORMATS is a structure with information about each supported file format, or from a specific format EXT, the value displayed on the field 'ext'.  It contains the following fields:

     ext
          The name of the file format.  This may match the file extension but Octave will automatically detect the file format.

     description
          A long description of the file format.

     isa
          A function handle to confirm if a file is of the specified format.

     write
          A function handle to write if a file is of the specified format.

     read
          A function handle to open files the specified format.

     info
          A function handle to obtain image information of the specified format.

     alpha
          Logical value if format supports alpha channel (transparency or matte).

     multipage
          Logical value if format supports multipage (multiple images per file).

     It is possible to change the way Octave manages file formats with the options "add", "remove", and "update", and supplying a structure FORMAT with the required fields.  The option "factory" resets the configuration to the default.

     This can be used by Octave packages to extend the image reading capabilities Octave, through use of the PKG_ADD and PKG_DEL commands.

     Read images from various file formats.

     Read an image as a matrix from the file FILENAME.  If there is no file FILENAME, and EXT was specified, it will look for a file with the extension EXT.  Finally, it will attempt to download and read an image from URL.

     The size and class of the output depends on the format of the image.  A color image is returned as an MxNx3 matrix.  Gray-level and black-and-white images are of size MxN. Multipage images will have an additional 4th dimension.

     The bit depth of the image determines the class of the output: "uint8", "uint16" or "single" for gray and color, and "logical" for black and white.  Note that indexed images always return the indexes for a colormap, independent if MAP is a requested output.  To obtain the actual RGB image, use 'ind2rgb'.  When more than one indexed image is being read, MAP is obtained from the first.  In some rare cases this may be incorrect and 'imfinfo' can be used to obtain the colormap of each image.

     See the Octave manual for more information in representing images.

     Some file formats, such as TIFF and GIF, are able to store multiple images in a single file.  IDX can be a scalar or vector specifying the index of the images to read.  By default, Octave will only read the first page.

     Depending on the file format, it is possible to configure the reading of images with PARAM, VAL pairs.  The following options are supported:

     '"Frames" or "Index"'
          This is an alternative method to specify IDX.  When specifying it in this way, its value can also be the string "all".

     '"Info"'
          This option exists for MATLAB compatibility and has no effect.  For maximum performance while reading multiple images from a single file, use the Index option.

     '"PixelRegion"'
          Controls the image region that is read.  Takes as value a cell array with two arrays of 3 elements '{ROWS COLS}'.  The elements in the array are the start, increment and end pixel to be read.  If the increment value is omitted, defaults to 1.  For example, the following are all equivalent:

               imread (filename, "PixelRegion", {[200 600] [300 700]});
               imread (filename, "PixelRegion", {[200 1 600] [300 1 700]});
               imread (filename)(200:600, 300:700);

     Display the image IM, where IM can be a 2-dimensional (grayscale image) or a 3-dimensional (RGB image) matrix.

     If LIMITS is a 2-element vector '[LOW, HIGH]', the image is shown using a display range between LOW and HIGH.  If an empty matrix is passed for LIMITS, the display range is computed as the range between the minimal and the maximal value in the image.

     If MAP is a valid color map, the image will be shown as an indexed image using the supplied color map.

     If a file name is given instead of an image, the file will be read and shown.

     If given, the parameter STRING_PARAM1 has value VALUE1.  STRING_PARAM1 can be any of the following:

     "displayrange"
          VALUE1 is the display range as described above.

     "colormap"
          VALUE1 is the colormap to use when displaying an indexed image.

     "xdata"
          If VALUE1 is a two element vector, it must contain horizontal axis limits in the form [xmin xmax]; Otherwise VALUE1 must be a vector and only the first and last elements will be used for xmin and xmax respectively.

     The image IMG can be a binary, grayscale, RGB, or multi-dimensional image.  The size and class of IMG should be the same as what should be expected when reading it with 'imread': the 3rd and 4th dimensions reserved for color space, and multiple pages respectively.  If it's an indexed image, the colormap MAP must also be specified.

     If EXT is not supplied, the file extension of FILENAME is used to determine the format.  The actual supported formats are dependent on options made during the build of Octave.  Use 'imformats' to check the support of the different image formats.

     Depending on the file format, it is possible to configure the writing of images with PARAM, VAL pairs.  The following options are supported:

          Alpha (transparency) channel for the image.  This must be a matrix with same class, and number of rows and columns of IMG.  In case of a multipage image, the size of the 4th dimension must also match and the third dimension must be a singleton.  By default, image will be completely opaque.

     'DelayTime'
          For formats that accept animations (such as GIF), controls for how long a frame is displayed until it moves to the next one.  The value must be scalar (which will applied to all frames in IMG), or a vector of length equal to the number of frames in IM.  The value is in seconds, must be between 0 and 655.35, and defaults to 0.5.

     'DisposalMethod'
          For formats that accept animations (such as GIF), controls what happens to a frame before drawing the next one.  Its value can be one of the following strings: "doNotSpecify" (default); "leaveInPlace"; "restoreBG"; and "restorePrevious", or a cell array of those string with length equal to the number of frames in IMG.

     'LoopCount'
          For formats that accept animations (such as GIF), controls how many times the sequence is repeated.  A value of Inf means an infinite loop (default), a value of 0 or 1 that the sequence is played only once (loops zero times), while a value of 2 or above loops that number of times (looping twice means it plays the complete sequence 3 times).  This option is ignored when there is only a single image at the end of writing the file.

     'Quality'
          Set the quality of the compression.  The value should be an integer between 0 and 100, with larger values indicating higher visual quality and lower compression.  Defaults to 75.

     'WriteMode'
          Some file formats, such as TIFF and GIF, are able to store multiple images in a single file.  This option specifies if IMG should be appended to the file (if it exists) or if a new file should be created for it (possibly overwriting an existing file).  The value should be the string "Overwrite" (default), or "Append".

          Despite this option, the most efficient method of writing a multipage image is to pass a 4 dimensional IMG to 'imwrite', the same matrix that could be expected when using 'imread' with the option "Index" set to "all".

 -- Function File: I = ind2gray (X, MAP)
     Convert a color indexed image to a grayscale intensity image.

     The image X must be an indexed image which will be converted using the colormap CMAP.  If CMAP does not contain enough colors for the image, pixels in X outside the range are mapped to the last color in the map before conversion to grayscale.

     The output I is of the same class as the input X and may be one of 'uint8', 'uint16', 'single', or 'double'.

     Implementation Note: There are several ways of converting colors to grayscale intensities.  This functions uses the luminance value obtained from 'rgb2ntsc' which is 'I = 0.299*R + 0.587*G + 0.114*B'.  Other possibilities include the value component from 'rgb2hsv' or using a single color channel from 'ind2rgb'.

     Convert an indexed image to red, green, and blue color components.

     The image X must be an indexed image which will be converted using the colormap MAP.  If MAP does not contain enough colors for the image, pixels in X outside the range are mapped to the last color in the map.

     The output may be a single RGB image (MxNx3 matrix where M and N are the original image X dimensions, one for each of the red, green and blue channels).  Alternatively, the individual red, green, and blue color matrices of size MxN may be returned.

     Multi-dimensional indexed images (of size MxNx1xK) are also supported.

     Convert an image in red-green-blue (RGB) color space to an indexed image.

     The input image RGB can be specified as a single matrix of size MxNx3, or as three separate variables, R, G, and B, its three color channels, red, green, and blue.

     It outputs an indexed image X and a colormap MAP to interpret an image exactly the same as the input.  No dithering or other form of color quantization is performed.  The output class of the indexed image X can be uint8, uint16 or double, whichever is required to specify the number of unique colors in the image (which will be equal to the number of rows in MAP) in order

     Multi-dimensional indexed images (of size MxNx3xK) are also supported, both via a single input (RGB) or its three color channels as separate variables.

     Read data from a string.

     The string STR is split into words that are repeatedly matched to the specifiers in FORMAT.  The first word is matched to the first specifier, the second to the second specifier and so forth.  If there are more words than specifiers, the process is repeated until all words have been processed.

     The string FORMAT describes how the words in STR should be parsed.  It may contain any combination of the following specifiers:

     '%s'
          The word is parsed as a string.

     '%f'
     '%n'
          The word is parsed as a number and converted to double.

     '%d'
     '%u'
          The word is parsed as a number and converted to int32.

     '%*', '%*f', '%*s'
          The word is skipped.

          For %s and %d, %f, %n, %u and the associated %*s ... specifiers an optional width can be specified as %Ns, etc.  where N is an integer > 1.  For %f, format specifiers like %N.Mf are allowed.

     'literals'
          In addition the format may contain literal character strings; these will be skipped during reading.

     Parsed word corresponding to the first specifier are returned in the first output argument and likewise for the rest of the specifiers.

     By default, FORMAT is "%f", meaning that numbers are read from STR.  This will do if STR contains only numeric fields.

     For example, the string

          STR = "\
          Bunny Bugs   5.5\n\
          Duck Daffy  -7.5e-5\n\
          Penguin Tux   6"

     can be read using

          [A, B, C] = strread (STR, "%s %s %f");

     Optional numeric argument FORMAT_REPEAT can be used for limiting the number of items read:

     -1
          (default) read all of the string until the end.

     N
          Read N times NARGOUT items.  0 (zero) is an acceptable value for FORMAT_REPEAT.

     The behavior of 'strread' can be changed via property-value pairs.  The following properties are recognized:

     "commentstyle"
          Parts of STR are considered comments and will be skipped.  VALUE is the comment style and can be any of the following.

             * "shell" Everything from '#' characters to the nearest end-of-line is skipped.

             * "c" Everything between '/*' and '*/' is skipped.

             * "c++" Everything from '//' characters to the nearest end-of-line is skipped.

             * "matlab" Everything from '%' characters to the nearest end-of-line is skipped.

             * user-supplied.  Two options: (1) One string, or 1x1 cell string: Skip everything to the right of it; (2) 2x1 cell string array: Everything between the left and right strings is skipped.

     "delimiter"
          Any character in VALUE will be used to split STR into words (default value = any whitespace).  Note that whitespace is implicitly added to the set of delimiter characters unless a "%s" format conversion specifier is supplied; see "whitespace" parameter below.  The set of delimiter characters cannot be empty; if needed Octave substitutes a space as delimiter.

     "emptyvalue"
          Value to return for empty numeric values in non-whitespace delimited data.  The default is NaN.  When the data type does not support NaN (int32 for example), then default is zero.

     "multipledelimsasone"
          Treat a series of consecutive delimiters, without whitespace in between, as a single delimiter.  Consecutive delimiter series need not be vertically "aligned".

     "treatasempty"
          Treat single occurrences (surrounded by delimiters or whitespace) of the string(s) in VALUE as missing values.

     "returnonerror"
          If VALUE true (1, default), ignore read errors and return normally.  If false (0), return an error.

     "whitespace"
          Any character in VALUE will be interpreted as whitespace and trimmed; the string defining whitespace must be enclosed in double quotes for proper processing of special characters like "\t".  In each data field, multiple consecutive whitespace characters are collapsed into one space and leading and trailing whitespace is removed.  The default value for whitespace is " \b\r\n\t" (note the space).  Whitespace is always added to the set of delimiter characters unless at least one "%s" format conversion specifier is supplied; in that case only whitespace explicitly specified in "delimiter" is retained as delimiter and removed from the set of whitespace characters.  If whitespace characters are to be kept as-is (in e.g., strings), specify an empty value (i.e., "") for "whitespace"; obviously, whitespace cannot be a delimiter then.

     When the number of words in STR doesn't match an exact multiple of the number of format conversion specifiers, strread's behavior depends on the last character of STR:

     last character = "\n"
          Data columns are padded with empty fields or Nan so that all columns have equal length

     last character is not "\n"
          Data columns are not padded; strread returns columns of unequal length

 -- Function File: C = textscan (STR, ...)
 -- Function File: [C, POSITION] = textscan (FID, ...)
     Read data from a text file or string.

     The string STR or file associated with FID is read from and parsed according to FORMAT.  The function behaves like 'strread' except it can also read from file instead of a string.  See the documentation of 'strread' for details.

     In addition to the options supported by 'strread', this function supports a few more:

        * "collectoutput": A value of 1 or true instructs textscan to concatenate consecutive columns of the same class in the output cell array.  A value of 0 or false (default) leaves output in distinct columns.

        * "endofline": Specify "\r", "\n" or "\r\n" (for CR, LF, or CRLF). If no value is given, it will be inferred from the file.  If set to "" (empty string) EOLs are ignored as delimiters and added to whitespace.

        * "headerlines": The first VALUE number of lines of FID are skipped.

        * "returnonerror": If set to numerical 1 or true (default), return normally when read errors have been encountered.  If set to 0 or false, return an error and no data.  As the string or file is read by columns rather than by rows, and because textscan is fairly forgiving as regards read errors, setting this option may have little or no actual effect.

     When reading from a character string, optional input argument N specifies the number of times FORMAT should be used (i.e., to limit the amount of data read).  When reading from file, N specifies the number of data lines to read; in this sense it differs slightly from the format repeat count in strread.

     The output C is a cell array whose second dimension is determined by the number of format specifiers.

     The second output, POSITION, provides the position, in characters, from the beginning of the file.

     If the format string is empty (not: omitted) and the file contains only numeric data (excluding headerlines), textscan will return data in a number of columns matching the number of numeric fields on the first data line of the file.

     Read data from a text file.

     The file FILENAME is read and parsed according to FORMAT.  The function behaves like 'strread' except it works by parsing a file instead of a string.  See the documentation of 'strread' for details.

     In addition to the options supported by 'strread', this function supports two more:

        * "headerlines": The first VALUE number of lines of FILENAME are skipped.

        * "endofline": Specify a single character or "\r\n".  If no value is given, it will be inferred from the file.  If set to "" (empty string) EOLs are ignored as delimiters.

     The optional input N (format repeat count) specifies the number of times the format string is to be used or the number of lines to be read, whichever happens first while reading.  The former is equivalent to requesting that the data output vectors should be of length N.  Note that when reading files with format strings referring to multiple lines, N should rather be the number of lines to be read than the number of format string uses.

     If the format string is empty (not just omitted) and the file contains only numeric data (excluding headerlines), textread will return a rectangular matrix with the number of columns matching the number of numeric fields on the first data line of the file.  Empty fields are returned as zero values.

     Examples:

            Assume a data file like:
            1 a 2 b
            3 c 4 d
            5 e

            [a, b] = textread (f, "%f %s")
            returns two columns of data, one with doubles, the other a
            cellstr array:
            a = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5]
            b = {"a"; "b"; "c"; "d"; "e"}

            [a, b] = textread (f, "%f %s", 3)
            (read data into two culumns, try to use the format string
            three times)
            returns
            a = [1; 2; 3]
            b = {"a"; "b"; "c"}


            With a data file like:
            1
            a
            2
            b

            [a, b] = textread (f, "%f %s", 2)
            returns a = 1 and b = {"a"}; i.e., the format string is used
            only once because the format string refers to 2 lines of the
            data file. To obtain 2x1 data output columns, specify N = 4
            (number of data lines containing all requested data) rather
            than 2.

     Show the current memory usage of the Java virtual machine (JVM) and run the garbage collector.

     When no return argument is given the info is printed to the screen.  Otherwise, the output cell array JMEM contains Maximum, Total, and Free memory (in bytes).

     All Java-based routines are run in the JVM's shared memory pool, a dedicated and separate part of memory claimed by the JVM from your computer's total memory (which comprises physical RAM and virtual memory / swap space on hard disk).

     The maximum allowable memory usage can be configured using the file 'java.opts'.  The directory where this file resides is determined by the environment variable 'OCTAVE_JAVA_DIR'.  If unset, the directory where 'javaaddpath.m' resides is used instead (typically 'OCTAVE_HOME/share/octave/OCTAVE_VERSION/m/java/').

     'java.opts' is a plain text file with one option per line.  The default initial memory size and default maximum memory size (which are both system dependent) can be overridden like so:

     -Xms64m

     -Xmx512m

     (in megabytes in this example).  You can adapt these values to your own requirements if your system has limited available physical memory or if you get Java memory errors.

     "Total memory" is what the operating system has currently assigned to the JVM and depends on actual and active memory usage.  "Free memory" is self-explanatory.  During operation of Java-based Octave functions the amount of Total and Free memory will vary, due to Java's own cleaning up and your operating system's memory management.

     Compute the P-norm condition number of a matrix.

     'cond (A)' is defined as 'norm (A, P) * norm (inv (A), P)'.

     By default, 'P = 2' is used which implies a (relatively slow) singular value decomposition.  Other possible selections are 'P = 1, Inf, "fro"' which are generally faster.  See 'norm' for a full discussion of possible P values.

     The condition number of a matrix quantifies the sensitivity of the matrix inversion operation when small changes are made to matrix elements.  Ideally the condition number will be close to 1.  When the number is large this indicates small changes (such as underflow or round-off error) will produce large changes in the resulting output.  In such cases the solution results from numerical computing are not likely to be accurate.

     Estimate the 1-norm condition number of a matrix A using T test vectors using a randomized 1-norm estimator.

     If T exceeds 5, then only 5 test vectors are used.

     If the matrix is not explicit, e.g., when estimating the condition number of A given an LU factorization, 'condest' uses the following functions:

     APPLY
          'A*x' for a matrix 'x' of size N by T.

     APPLY_T
          'A'*x' for a matrix 'x' of size N by T.

     SOLVE
          'A \ b' for a matrix 'b' of size N by T.

     SOLVE_T
          'A' \ b' for a matrix 'b' of size N by T.

     The implicit version requires an explicit dimension N.

     'condest' uses a randomized algorithm to approximate the 1-norms.

     Return the exponential of a matrix.

     The matrix exponential is defined as the infinite Taylor series

          expm (A) = I + A + A^2/2! + A^3/3! + ...

     However, the Taylor series is _not_ the way to compute the matrix exponential; see Moler and Van Loan, 'Nineteen Dubious Ways to Compute the Exponential of a Matrix', SIAM Review, 1978.  This routine uses Ward's diagonal Pade' approximation method with three step preconditioning (SIAM Journal on Numerical Analysis, 1977).  Diagonal Pade' approximations are rational polynomials of matrices

               -1
          D (A)   N (A)

     whose Taylor series matches the first '2q+1' terms of the Taylor series above; direct evaluation of the Taylor series (with the same preconditioning steps) may be desirable in lieu of the Pade' approximation when 'Dq(A)' is ill-conditioned.

     using Householder reflections to guard against loss of orthogonality.

     If V is a vector, then H contains the Hessenberg matrix such that a*u == u*h+rk*ek', in which 'rk = a*u(:,k)-u*h(:,k)', and ek' is the vector '[0, 0, ..., 1]' of length 'k'.  Otherwise, H is meaningless.

     If V is a vector and K is greater than 'length (A) - 1', then H contains the Hessenberg matrix such that 'a*u == u*h'.

     The value of NU is the dimension of the span of the Krylov subspace (based on EPS1).

     If B is a vector and K is greater than M-1, then H contains the Hessenberg decomposition of A.

     The optional parameter EPS1 is the threshold for zero.  The default value is 1e-12.

     If the optional parameter PFLG is nonzero, row pivoting is used to improve numerical behavior.  The default value is 0.

 -- Function File: X = linsolve (A, B, OPTS)
 -- Function File: [X, R] = linsolve (...)
     Solve the linear system 'A*x = b'.

     With no options, this function is equivalent to the left division operator ('x = A \ b') or the matrix-left-divide function ('x = mldivide (A, b)').

     Octave ordinarily examines the properties of the matrix A and chooses a solver that best matches the matrix.  By passing a structure OPTS to 'linsolve' you can inform Octave directly about the matrix A.  In this case Octave will skip the matrix examination and proceed directly to solving the linear system.

     *Warning:* If the matrix A does not have the properties listed in the OPTS structure then the result will not be accurate AND no warning will be given.  When in doubt, let Octave examine the matrix and choose the appropriate solver as this step takes little time and the result is cached so that it is only done once per linear system.

     Possible OPTS fields (set value to true/false):

     LT
          A is lower triangular

     UT
          A is upper triangular

     UHESS
          A is upper Hessenberg (currently makes no difference)

     SYM
          A is symmetric or complex Hermitian (currently makes no difference)

     POSDEF
          A is positive definite

     RECT
          A is general rectangular (currently makes no difference)

     Apply Higham and Tisseur's randomized block 1-norm estimator to matrix A using T test vectors.

     If T exceeds 5, then only 5 test vectors are used.

     If the matrix is not explicit, e.g., when estimating the norm of 'inv (A)' given an LU factorization, 'onenormest' applies A and its conjugate transpose through a pair of functions APPLY and APPLY_T, respectively, to a dense matrix of size N by T.  The implicit version requires an explicit dimension N.

     Returns the norm estimate EST, two vectors V and W related by norm '(W, 1) = EST * norm (V, 1)', and the number of iterations ITER.  The number of iterations is limited to 10 and is at least 2.

 -- Function File: rank (A)
 -- Function File: rank (A, TOL)
     Compute the rank of matrix A, using the singular value decomposition.

     The rank is taken to be the number of singular values of A that are greater than the specified tolerance TOL.  If the second argument is omitted, it is taken to be

          tol = max (size (A)) * sigma(1) * eps;

     where 'eps' is machine precision and 'sigma(1)' is the largest singular value of A.

     The rank of a matrix is the number of linearly independent rows or columns and determines how many particular solutions exist to a system of equations.  Use 'null' for finding the remaining homogenous solutions.

     Example:

          x = [1 2 3
               4 5 6
               7 8 9];
          rank (x)
            => 2

     The number of linearly independent rows is only 2 because the final row is a linear combination of -1*row1 + 2*row2.

     Compress the list of files specified in FILES.

     FILES is a character array or cell array of strings.  Shell wildcards in the filename such as '*' or '?' are accepted and expanded.  Each file is compressed separately and a new file with a '".bz2"' extension is created.  The original files are not modified, but existing compressed files will be silently overwritten.

     If DIR is defined the compressed files are placed in this directory, rather than the original directory where the uncompressed file resides.  If DIR does not exist it is created.

     The optional output FILELIST is a list of the compressed files.

 -- Function File: cast (VAL, "TYPE")
     Convert VAL to data type TYPE.

     VAL must be one of the numeric classes:

          "double"
          "single"
          "logical"
          "char"
          "int8"

          "uint8"
          "uint16"
          "uint32"
          "uint64"

     The value VAL may be modified to fit within the range of the new type.

     Examples:

          cast (-5, "uint8")
             => 0
          cast (300, "int8")
             => 127

 -- Function File: compare_versions (V1, V2, OPERATOR)
     Compare two version strings using the given OPERATOR.

     This function assumes that versions V1 and V2 are arbitrarily long strings made of numeric and period characters possibly followed by an arbitrary string (e.g., "1.2.3", "0.3", "0.1.2+", or "1.2.3.4-test1").

     The version is first split into numeric and character portions and then the parts are padded to be the same length (i.e., "1.1" would be padded to be "1.1.0" when being compared with "1.1.1", and separately, the character parts of the strings are padded with nulls).

     The operator can be any logical operator from the set

        * "==" equal

        * "<" less than

        * "<=" less than or equal to

        * ">" greater than

        * ">=" greater than or equal to

        * "!=" not equal

        * "~=" not equal

     Note that version "1.1-test2" will compare as greater than "1.1-test10".  Also, since the numeric part is compared first, "a" compares less than "1a" because the second string starts with a numeric part even though 'double ("a")' is greater than 'double ("1").'

     Print or return a string of the form CPU-VENDOR-OS that identifies the type of computer that Octave is running on.

     If invoked with an output argument, the value is returned instead of printed.  For example:

          computer ()
             -| i586-pc-linux-gnu

          mycomp = computer ()
             => mycomp = "i586-pc-linux-gnu"

     If two output arguments are requested, also return the maximum number of elements for an array.  This will depend on whether Octave has been compiled with 32-bit or 64-bit index vectors.

     If three output arguments are requested, also return the byte order of the current system as a character ("B" for big-endian or "L" for little-endian).

     If the argument "arch" is specified, return a string indicating the architecture of the computer on which Octave is running.

     'dbtype'
          Display the code of the function being debugged, enumerating the line numbers.

     'dblist'
          List 10 lines of code centered around the line number where execution is stopped.

     'dbstep'
     'dbnext'
          Execute (step) one or more lines, follow execution into (step into) a function call, or execute until the end of a function (step out), and re-enter debug mode.

     'dbcont'
          Continue normal code execution from the debug prompt.

     'dbquit'
          Quit debugging mode immediately and return to the main prompt.

     If DIRECTORY is not specified then list the present working directory.

     If a return value is requested, return a structure array with the fields

     name
          File or directory name.

     date
          Timestamp of file modification (string value).

     bytes
          File size in bytes.

     isdir
          True if name is a directory.

     datenum
          Timestamp of file modification as serial date number (double).

     statinfo
          Information structure returned from 'stat'.

     If DIRECTORY is a filename, rather than a directory, then return information about the named file.  DIRECTORY may also be a list rather than a single directory or file.

     DIRECTORY is subject to shell expansion if it contains any wildcard characters '*', '?', '[]'.  To find a literal example of a wildcard character the wildcard must be escaped using the backslash operator '\'.

     Note that for symbolic links, 'dir' returns information about the file that the symbolic link points to rather than the link itself.  However, if the link points to a nonexistent file, 'dir' returns information about the link.

 -- Command: edit NAME
 -- Command: edit FIELD VALUE
 -- Command: VALUE = edit get FIELD
     Edit the named function, or change editor settings.

     If 'edit' is called with the name of a file or function as its argument it will be opened in the text editor defined by 'EDITOR'.

        * If the function NAME is available in a file on your path and that file is modifiable, then it will be edited in place.  If it is a system function, then it will first be copied to the directory 'HOME' (see below) and then edited.  If no file is found, then the m-file variant, ending with ".m", will be considered.  If still no file is found, then variants with a leading "@" and then with both a leading "@" and trailing ".m" will be considered.

        * If NAME is the name of a function defined in the interpreter but not in an m-file, then an m-file will be created in 'HOME' to contain that function along with its current definition.

        * If 'NAME.cc' is specified, then it will search for 'NAME.cc' in the path and try to modify it, otherwise it will create a new '.cc' file in the current directory.  If NAME happens to be an m-file or interpreter defined function, then the text of that function will be inserted into the .cc file as a comment.

        * If 'NAME.ext' is on your path then it will be edited, otherwise the editor will be started with 'NAME.ext' in the current directory as the filename.  If 'NAME.ext' is not modifiable, it will be copied to 'HOME' before editing.

          *Warning:* You may need to clear NAME before the new definition is available.  If you are editing a .cc file, you will need to execute 'mkoctfile NAME.cc' before the definition will be available.

     If 'edit' is called with FIELD and VALUE variables, the value of the control field FIELD will be set to VALUE.  If an output argument is requested and the first input argument is 'get' then 'edit' will return the value of the control field FIELD.  If the control field does not exist, edit will return a structure containing all fields and values.  Thus, 'edit get all' returns a complete control structure.

     The following control fields are used:

     'home'
          This is the location of user local m-files.  Be sure it is in your path.  The default is '~/octave'.

     'author'
          This is the name to put after the "## Author:" field of new functions.  By default it guesses from the 'gecos' field of the password database.

     'email'
          This is the e-mail address to list after the name in the author field.  By default it guesses '<$LOGNAME@$HOSTNAME>', and if '$HOSTNAME' is not defined it uses 'uname -n'.  You probably want to override this.  Be sure to use the format '<user@host>'.

     'license'

          'gpl'
               GNU General Public License (default).

          'bsd'
               BSD-style license without advertising clause.

          'pd'
               Public domain.

          '"text"'
               Your own default copyright and license.

          Unless you specify 'pd', edit will prepend the copyright statement with "Copyright (C) yyyy Function Author".

     'mode'
          This value determines whether the editor should be started in async mode (editor is started in the background and Octave continues) or sync mode (Octave waits until the editor exits).  Set it to "sync" to start the editor in sync mode.  The default is "async" (*note system: XREFsystem.).

     'editinplace'
          Determines whether files should be edited in place, without regard to whether they are modifiable or not.  The default is 'false'.

'Octave:invalid-input-arg'
     Indicates that a function was called with invalid input arguments.

'Octave:invalid-fun-call'
     Indicates that a function was called in an incorrect way, e.g., wrong number of input arguments.

'Octave:invalid-indexing'
     Indicates that a data-type was indexed incorrectly, e.g., real-value index for arrays, nonexistent field of a structure.

'Octave:bad-alloc'
     Indicates that memory couldn't be allocated.

'Octave:undefined-function'
     Indicates a call to a function that is not defined.  The function may exist but Octave is unable to find it in the search path.

     Build complete filename from separate parts.

     Joins any number of path components intelligently.  The return value is the concatenation of each component with exactly one file separator between each non empty part and at most one leading and/or trailing file separator.

     If the last component part is a cell array, returns a cell array of filepaths, one for each element in the last component, e.g.:

          fullfile ("/home/username", "data", {"f1.csv", "f2.csv", "f3.csv"})
          =>  /home/username/data/f1.csv

            =>
               {
                 [1,1] = foo
                 [1,2] = foo1
               }

     If EXCLUSIONS is given, then the variable(s) will be unique to each other and to EXCLUSIONS (EXCLUSIONS may be either a string or a cellstr).

          x = 3.141;
          genvarname ("x", who ())
            => x1

     Note that the result is a char array or cell array of strings, not the variables themselves.  To define a variable, 'eval()' can be used.  The following trivial example sets 'x' to '42'.

          name = genvarname ("x");
          eval ([name " = 42"]);
            => x =  42

     This can be useful for creating unique struct field names.

          x = struct ();
          for i = 1:3
            x.(genvarname ("a", fieldnames (x))) = i;
          endfor
            => x =
               {
                 a =  1
                 a1 =  2
                 a2 =  3
               }

     Since variable names may only contain letters, digits, and underscores, 'genvarname' will replace any sequence of disallowed characters with an underscore.  Also, variables may not begin with a digit; in this case an 'x' is added before the variable name.

     Variable names beginning and ending with two underscores "__" are valid, but they are used internally by Octave and should generally be avoided; therefore, 'genvarname' will not generate such names.

     'genvarname' will also ensure that returned names do not clash with keywords such as "for" and "if".  A number will be appended if necessary.  Note, however, that this does *not* include function names such as "sin".  Such names should be included in EXCLUSIONS if necessary.

 -- Function File: FILELIST = gzip (FILES)
 -- Function File: FILELIST = gzip (FILES, DIR)
     Compress the list of files and directories specified in FILES.

     FILES is a character array or cell array of strings.  Shell wildcards in the filename such as '*' or '?' are accepted and expanded.  Each file is compressed separately and a new file with a '".gz"' extension is created.  The original files are not modified, but existing compressed files will be silently overwritten.  If a directory is specified then 'gzip' recursively compresses all files in the directory.

     If DIR is defined the compressed files are placed in this directory, rather than the original directory where the uncompressed file resides.  If DIR does not exist it is created.

     The optional output FILELIST is a list of the compressed files.

     Get license information for Octave and Octave packages.

     GNU Octave is free software distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL), and a license manager makes no sense.  This function is provided only for MATLAB compatibility.

     When called with no extra input arguments, it returns the Octave license, otherwise the first input defines the operation mode and must be one of the following strings: 'inuse', 'test', and 'checkout'.  The optional FEATURE argument can either be "octave" (core), or an Octave package.

     "inuse"
          Returns a list of loaded features, i.e., octave and the list of loaded packages.  If an output is requested, it returns a struct array with the fields "feature", and "user".

     "test"
          Return true if the specified FEATURE is installed, false otherwise.

          An optional third argument "enable" or "disable" is accepted but ignored.

     "checkout"
          Return true if the specified FEATURE is installed, false otherwise.  An optional second output will have an error message if a package is not installed.

 -- Command: ls
 -- Command: ls FILENAMES

 -- Command: ls OPTIONS FILENAMES
 -- Function File: LIST = ls (...)

     List directory contents.

     The 'ls' command is implemented by calling the native operating system's directory listing command--available OPTIONS will vary from system to system.

     Filenames are subject to shell expansion if they contain any wildcard characters '*', '?', '[]'.  To find a literal example of a wildcard character the wildcard must be escaped using the backslash operator '\'.

     If the optional output LIST is requested then 'ls' returns a character array with one row for each file/directory name.

     Example usage on a UNIX-like system:

          ls -l
               -| total 12
               -| -rw-r--r--   1 jwe  users  4488 Aug 19 04:02 foo.m

 -- Function File: CHOICE = menu (TITLE, OPT1, ...)
 -- Function File: CHOICE = menu (TITLE, {OPT1, ...})
     Display a menu with heading TITLE and options OPT1, ..., and wait for user input.

     If the GUI is running, or Java is available, the menu is displayed graphically using 'listdlg'.  Otherwise, the title and menu options are printed on the console.

     TITLE is a string and the options may be input as individual strings or as a cell array of strings.

     The return value CHOICE is the number of the option selected by the user counting from 1.

     This function is useful for interactive programs.  There is no limit to the number of options that may be passed in, but it may be confusing to present more than will fit easily on one screen.

 -- Command: mkoctfile [-options] file ...
 -- Function File: [OUTPUT, STATUS] = mkoctfile (...)

     The 'mkoctfile' function compiles source code written in C, C++, or Fortran.  Depending on the options used with 'mkoctfile', the compiled code can be called within Octave or can be used as a stand-alone application.

     'mkoctfile' can be called from the shell prompt or from the Octave prompt.  Calling it from the Octave prompt simply delegates the call to the shell prompt.  The output is stored in the OUTPUT variable and the exit status in the STATUS variable.

     'mkoctfile' accepts the following options, all of which are optional except for the file name of the code you wish to compile:

     '-I DIR'
          Add the include directory DIR to compile commands.

     '-D DEF'
          Add the definition DEF to the compiler call.

     '-l LIB'
          Add the library LIB to the link command.

     '-L DIR'
          Add the library directory DIR to the link command.

     '-M'
     '--depend'
          Generate dependency files (.d) for C and C++ source files.

     '-R DIR'
          Add the run-time path to the link command.

     '-Wl,...'
          Pass flags though the linker like "-Wl,-rpath=...".  The quotes are needed since commas are interpreted as command separators.

     '-W...'
          Pass flags though the compiler like "-Wa,OPTION".

     '-c'
          Compile but do not link.

     '-g'
          Enable debugging options for compilers.

     '-o FILE'
     '--output FILE'
          Output file name.  Default extension is .oct (or .mex if '--mex' is specified) unless linking a stand-alone executable.

     '-p VAR'
     '--print VAR'
          Print the configuration variable VAR.  Recognized variables are:

 -- Function File: [STATUS, MSG, MSGID] = movefile (...)
     Move the source files or directories F1 to the destination F2.

     The name F1 may contain globbing patterns.  If F1 expands to multiple file names, F2 must be a directory.  If no destination F2 is specified then the destination is the present working directory.  If F2 is a file name then F1 is renamed to F2.

     When the force flag 'f' is given any existing files will be overwritten without prompting.

     If successful, STATUS is 1, and MSG, MSGID are empty character strings ("").  Otherwise, STATUS is 0, MSG contains a system-dependent error message, and MSGID contains a unique message identifier.  Note that the status code is exactly opposite that of the 'system' command.

However for MATLAB compatibility all variable, function, and structure field names should be shorter than the length returned by 'namelengthmax'.  In particular, variables stored to a MATLAB file format ('*.mat') will have their names truncated to this length.

 -- Function File: SOUT] = orderfields (S1, {CELLSTR})
 -- Function File: SOUT] = orderfields (S1, P)
 -- Function File: [SOUT, P] = orderfields (...)
     Return a _copy_ of S1 with fields arranged alphabetically, or as specified by the second input.

     Given one input struct S1, arrange field names alphabetically.

     If a second struct argument is given, arrange field names in S1 as they appear in S2.  The second argument may also specify the order in a cell array of strings CELLSTR.  The second argument may also be a permutation vector.

     The optional second output argument P is the permutation vector which converts the original name order to the new name order.

     Examples:

          s = struct ("d", 4, "b", 2, "a", 1, "c", 3);

 -- Function File: [REG, PROP] = parseparams (PARAMS)
 -- Function File: [REG, VAR1, ...] = parseparams (PARAMS, NAME1, DEFAULT1, ...)
     Return in REG the cell elements of PARAM up to the first string element and in PROP all remaining elements beginning with the first string element.

     For example:

          [reg, prop] = parseparams ({1, 2, "linewidth", 10})
          reg =
          {
            [1,1] = 1
            [1,2] = 2
          }
          prop =
          {
            [1,1] = linewidth
            [1,2] = 10
          }

     The parseparams function may be used to separate regular numeric arguments from additional arguments given as property/value pairs of the VARARGIN cell array.

     In the second form of the call, available options are specified directly with their default values given as name-value pairs.  If PARAMS do not form name-value pairs, or if an option occurs that does not match any of the available options, an error occurs.

     When called from an m-file function, the error is prefixed with the name of the caller function.

     The matching of options is case-insensitive.

 -- Command: run SCRIPT
 -- Function File: run ("SCRIPT")
     Run SCRIPT in the current workspace.

     Scripts which reside in directories specified in Octave's load path, and which end with the extension '".m"', can be run simply by typing their name.  For scripts not located on the load path, use 'run'.

     The file name SCRIPT can be a bare, fully qualified, or relative filename and with or without a file extension.  If no extension is specified, Octave will first search for a script with the '".m"' extension before falling back to the script name without an extension.

     Implementation Note: If SCRIPT includes a path component, then 'run' first changes the working directory to the directory where SCRIPT is found.  Next, the script is executed.  Finally, 'run' returns to the original working directory unless 'script' has specifically changed directories.

 -- Function File: SOUT = setfield (S, FIELD, VAL)
 -- Function File: SOUT = setfield (S, SIDX1, FIELD1, FIDX1, SIDX2, FIELD2, FIDX2, ..., VAL)

     Return a _copy_ of the structure S with the field member FIELD set to the value VAL.

     For example:

          S = struct ();
          S = setfield (S, "foo bar", 42);

     This is equivalent to

          S.("foo bar") = 42;

     Note that ordinary structure syntax 'S.foo bar = 42' cannot be used here, as the field name is not a valid Octave identifier because of the space character.  Using arbitrary strings for field names is incompatible with MATLAB, and this usage will emit a warning if the warning ID 'Octave:language-extension' is enabled.  *Note XREFwarning_ids::.

     With the second calling form, set a field of a structure array.  The input SIDX selects an element of the structure array, FIELD specifies the field name of the selected element, and FIDX selects which element of the field (in the case of an array or cell array).  The SIDX, FIELD, and FIDX inputs can be repeated to address nested structure array elements.  The structure array index and field element index must be cell arrays while the field name must be a string.

     For example:

          S = struct ("baz", 42);
          setfield (S, {1}, "foo", {1}, "bar", 54)
          =>
            ans =
              scalar structure containing the fields:
                baz =  42
                foo =
                  scalar structure containing the fields:
                    bar =  54

     The example begins with an ordinary scalar structure to which a nested scalar structure is added.  In all cases, if the structure index SIDX is not specified it defaults to 1 (scalar structure).  Thus, the example above could be written more concisely as 'setfield (S, "foo", "bar", 54)'

     Finally, an example with nested structure arrays:

          SA.foo = 1;
          SA = setfield (SA, {2}, "bar", {3}, "baz", {1, 4}, 5);
          SA(2).bar(3)
          =>
            ans =
              scalar structure containing the fields:
                baz =  0   0   0   5

     Here SA is a structure array whose field at elements 1 and 2 is in turn another structure array whose third element is a simple scalar structure.  The terminal scalar structure has a field which contains a matrix value.

     Note that the same result as in the above example could be achieved by:

          SA.foo = 1;
          SA(2).bar(3).baz(1,4) = 5

                 idx =
                 {

     Pack the list of files and directories specified in FILES into the TAR archive TARFILE.

     FILES is a character array or cell array of strings.  Shell wildcards in the filename such as '*' or '?' are accepted and expanded.  Directories are recursively traversed and all files are added to the archive.

     If ROOTDIR is defined then any files without absolute pathnames are located relative to ROOTDIR rather than the current directory.

     The optional output FILELIST is a list of the files that were included in the archive.

 -- Function File: FNAME = tmpnam ()
 -- Function File: FNAME = tmpnam (DIR)
 -- Function File: FNAME = tmpnam (DIR, PREFIX)
     Return a unique temporary file name as a string.

     If PREFIX is omitted, a value of "oct-" is used.

     If DIR is also omitted, the default directory for temporary files ('P_tmpdir' is used.  If DIR is provided, it must exist, otherwise the default directory for temporary files is used.

     Programming Note: Because the named file is not opened by 'tmpnam', it is possible, though relatively unlikely, that it will not be available by the time your program attempts to open it.  If this is a concern, see 'tmpfile'.  The functions 'tmpnam' and 'tempname' are equivalent with the latter provided for MATLAB compatibility.

     *Caution*: 'tmpnam' will be removed in a future version of Octave.  Use the equivalent 'tempname' in all new code.

     Unpack the archive FILE based on its extension to the directory DIR.

     If FILE is a list of strings, then each file is unpacked individually.  Shell wildcards in the filename such as '*' or '?' are accepted and expanded.

     If DIR is not specified or is empty ('[]'), it defaults to the current directory.  If a directory is in the file list, then FILETYPE must also be specified.

     The specific archive filetype is inferred from the extension of the file.  The FILETYPE may also be specified directly using a string which corresponds to a known extension.

     Valid filetype extensions:

     'bz'
     'bz2'
          bzip archive

     'gz'
          gzip archive

     'tar'
          tar archive

     'tarbz'
     'tarbz2'
     'tbz'
     'tbz2'
          tar + bzip archive

     'targz'
     'tgz'
          tar + gzip archive

     'z'
          compress archive

     'zip'
          zip archive

     The optional return value is a list of FILES unpacked.

'Octave:abbreviated-property-match'
     By default, the 'Octave:abbreviated-property-match' warning is enabled.

'Octave:array-to-scalar'
     If the 'Octave:array-to-scalar' warning is enabled, Octave will warn when an implicit conversion from an array to a scalar value is attempted.  By default, the 'Octave:array-to-scalar' warning is disabled.

'Octave:array-to-vector'
     If the 'Octave:array-to-vector' warning is enabled, Octave will warn when an implicit conversion from an array to a vector value is attempted.  By default, the 'Octave:array-to-vector' warning is disabled.

'Octave:assign-as-truth-value'
     If the 'Octave:assign-as-truth-value' warning is enabled, a warning is issued for statements like

          if (s = t)
            ...

     since such statements are not common, and it is likely that the intent was to write

          if (s == t)
            ...

     instead.

     There are times when it is useful to write code that contains assignments within the condition of a 'while' or 'if' statement.  For example, statements like

          while (c = getc ())
            ...

     are common in C programming.

     It is possible to avoid all warnings about such statements by disabling the 'Octave:assign-as-truth-value' warning, but that may also let real errors like

          if (x = 1)  # intended to test (x == 1)!
            ...

     slip by.

     In such cases, it is possible suppress errors for specific statements by writing them with an extra set of parentheses.  For example, writing the previous example as

          while ((c = getc ()))
            ...

     will prevent the warning from being printed for this statement, while allowing Octave to warn about other assignments used in conditional contexts.

     By default, the 'Octave:assign-as-truth-value' warning is enabled.

'Octave:associativity-change'
     If the 'Octave:associativity-change' warning is enabled, Octave will warn about possible changes in the meaning of some code due to changes in associativity for some operators.  Associativity changes have typically been made for MATLAB compatibility.  By default, the 'Octave:associativity-change' warning is enabled.

'Octave:autoload-relative-file-name'
     If the 'Octave:autoload-relative-file-name' is enabled, Octave will warn when parsing autoload() function calls with relative paths to function files.  This usually happens when using autoload() calls in PKG_ADD files, when the PKG_ADD file is not in the same directory as the .oct file referred to by the autoload() command.  By default, the 'Octave:autoload-relative-file-name' warning is enabled.

'Octave:built-in-variable-assignment'
     By default, the 'Octave:built-in-variable-assignment' warning is enabled.

'Octave:deprecated-keyword'
     If the 'Octave:deprecated-keyword' warning is enabled, a warning is issued when Octave encounters a keyword that is obsolete and scheduled for removal from Octave.  By default, the 'Octave:deprecated-keyword' warning is enabled.

'Octave:divide-by-zero'
     If the 'Octave:divide-by-zero' warning is enabled, a warning is issued when Octave encounters a division by zero.  By default, the 'Octave:divide-by-zero' warning is enabled.

'Octave:fopen-file-in-path'
     By default, the 'Octave:fopen-file-in-path' warning is enabled.

'Octave:function-name-clash'
     If the 'Octave:function-name-clash' warning is enabled, a warning is issued when Octave finds that the name of a function defined in a function file differs from the name of the file.  (If the names disagree, the name declared inside the file is ignored.)  By default, the 'Octave:function-name-clash' warning is enabled.

'Octave:future-time-stamp'
     If the 'Octave:future-time-stamp' warning is enabled, Octave will print a warning if it finds a function file with a time stamp that is in the future.  By default, the 'Octave:future-time-stamp' warning is enabled.

'Octave:glyph-render'
     By default, the 'Octave:glyph-render' warning is enabled.

'Octave:imag-to-real'
     If the 'Octave:imag-to-real' warning is enabled, a warning is printed for implicit conversions of complex numbers to real numbers.  By default, the 'Octave:imag-to-real' warning is disabled.

'Octave:language-extension'
     Print warnings when using features that are unique to the Octave language and that may still be missing in MATLAB.  By default, the 'Octave:language-extension' warning is disabled.  The '--traditional' or '--braindead' startup options for Octave may also be of use, *note Command Line Options::.

'Octave:load-file-in-path'
     By default, the 'Octave:load-file-in-path' warning is enabled.

'Octave:logical-conversion'
     By default, the 'Octave:logical-conversion' warning is enabled.

'Octave:md5sum-file-in-path'
     By default, the 'Octave:md5sum-file-in-path' warning is enabled.

'Octave:missing-glyph'
     By default, the 'Octave:missing-glyph' warning is enabled.

'Octave:missing-semicolon'
     If the 'Octave:missing-semicolon' warning is enabled, Octave will warn when statements in function definitions don't end in semicolons.  By default the 'Octave:missing-semicolon' warning is disabled.

'Octave:mixed-string-concat'
     If the 'Octave:mixed-string-concat' warning is enabled, print a warning when concatenating a mixture of double and single quoted strings.  By default, the 'Octave:mixed-string-concat' warning is disabled.

'Octave:neg-dim-as-zero'
     If the 'Octave:neg-dim-as-zero' warning is enabled, print a warning for expressions like

          eye (-1)

     By default, the 'Octave:neg-dim-as-zero' warning is disabled.

'Octave:nested-functions-coerced'
     By default, the 'Octave:nested-functions-coerced' warning is enabled.

'Octave:noninteger-range-as-index'
     By default, the 'Octave:noninteger-range-as-index' warning is enabled.

'Octave:num-to-str'
     If the 'Octave:num-to-str' warning is enable, a warning is printed for implicit conversions of numbers to their ASCII character equivalents when strings are constructed using a mixture of strings and numbers in matrix notation.  For example,

          [ "f", 111, 111 ]
          => "foo"

     elicits a warning if the 'Octave:num-to-str' warning is enabled.  By default, the 'Octave:num-to-str' warning is enabled.

'Octave:possible-matlab-short-circuit-operator'
     If the 'Octave:possible-matlab-short-circuit-operator' warning is enabled, Octave will warn about using the not short circuiting operators '&' and '|' inside 'if' or 'while' conditions.  They normally never short circuit, but MATLAB always short circuits if any logical operators are used in a condition.  You can turn on the option

          do_braindead_shortcircuit_evaluation (1)

     if you would like to enable this short-circuit evaluation in Octave.  Note that the '&&' and '||' operators always short circuit in both Octave and MATLAB, so it's only necessary to enable MATLAB-style short-circuiting if it's too arduous to modify existing code that relies on this behavior.  By default, the 'Octave:possible-matlab-short-circuit-operator' warning is enabled.

'Octave:precedence-change'
     If the 'Octave:precedence-change' warning is enabled, Octave will warn about possible changes in the meaning of some code due to changes in precedence for some operators.  Precedence changes have typically been made for MATLAB compatibility.  By default, the 'Octave:precedence-change' warning is enabled.

'Octave:recursive-path-search'
     By default, the 'Octave:recursive-path-search' warning is enabled.

'Octave:remove-init-dir'
     The 'path' function changes the search path that Octave uses to find functions.  It is possible to set the path to a value which excludes Octave's own built-in functions.  If the 'Octave:remove-init-dir' warning is enabled then Octave will warn when the 'path' function has been used in a way that may render Octave unworkable.  By default, the 'Octave:remove-init-dir' warning is enabled.

'Octave:reload-forces-clear'
     If several functions have been loaded from the same file, Octave must clear all the functions before any one of them can be reloaded.  If the 'Octave:reload-forces-clear' warning is enabled, Octave will warn you when this happens, and print a list of the additional functions that it is forced to clear.  By default, the 'Octave:reload-forces-clear' warning is enabled.

'Octave:resize-on-range-error'
     If the 'Octave:resize-on-range-error' warning is enabled, print a warning when a matrix is resized by an indexed assignment with indices outside the current bounds.  By default, the ## 'Octave:resize-on-range-error' warning is disabled.

'Octave:separator-insert'
     Print warning if commas or semicolons might be inserted automatically in literal matrices.  By default, the 'Octave:separator-insert' warning is disabled.

'Octave:shadowed-function'
     By default, the 'Octave:shadowed-function' warning is enabled.

'Octave:single-quote-string'
     Print warning if a single quote character is used to introduce a string constant.  By default, the 'Octave:single-quote-string' warning is disabled.

'Octave:nearly-singular-matrix'
'Octave:singular-matrix'
     By default, the 'Octave:nearly-singular-matrix' and 'Octave:singular-matrix' warnings are enabled.

'Octave:sqrtm:SingularMatrix'
     By default, the 'Octave:sqrtm:SingularMatrix' warning is enabled.

'Octave:str-to-num'
     If the 'Octave:str-to-num' warning is enabled, a warning is printed for implicit conversions of strings to their numeric ASCII equivalents.  For example,

          "abc" + 0
          => 97 98 99

     elicits a warning if the 'Octave:str-to-num' warning is enabled.  By default, the 'Octave:str-to-num' warning is disabled.

'Octave:undefined-return-values'
     If the 'Octave:undefined-return-values' warning is disabled, print a warning if a function does not define all the values in the return list which are expected.  By default, the 'Octave:undefined-return-values' warning is enabled.

'Octave:variable-switch-label'
     If the 'Octave:variable-switch-label' warning is enabled, Octave will print a warning if a switch label is not a constant or constant expression.  By default, the 'Octave:variable-switch-label' warning is disabled.

 -- Function File: [X, FVAL, INFO, OUTPUT] = fminbnd (FUN, A, B, OPTIONS)
     Find a minimum point of a univariate function.

     FUN should be a function handle or name.  A, B specify a starting interval.  OPTIONS is a structure specifying additional options.  Currently, 'fminbnd' recognizes these options: "FunValCheck", "OutputFcn", "TolX", "MaxIter", "MaxFunEvals".  For a description of these options, see *note optimset: XREFoptimset.

     On exit, the function returns X, the approximate minimum point and FVAL, the function value thereof.

     INFO is an exit flag that can have these values:

        * 1 The algorithm converged to a solution.

        * 0 Maximum number of iterations or function evaluations has been exhausted.

        * -1 The algorithm has been terminated from user output function.

     Notes: The search for a minimum is restricted to be in the interval bound by A and B.  If you only have an initial point to begin searching from you will need to use an unconstrained minimization algorithm such as 'fminunc' or 'fminsearch'.  'fminbnd' internally uses a Golden Section search strategy.

 -- Function File: X = fminsearch (FUN, X0)
 -- Function File: X = fminsearch (FUN, X0, OPTIONS)
 -- Function File: [X, FVAL] = fminsearch (...)

     Find a value of X which minimizes the function FUN.

     The search begins at the point X0 and iterates using the Nelder & Mead Simplex algorithm (a derivative-free method).  This algorithm is better-suited to functions which have discontinuities or for which a gradient-based search such as 'fminunc' fails.

     Options for the search are provided in the parameter OPTIONS using the function 'optimset'.  Currently, 'fminsearch' accepts the options: "TolX", "MaxFunEvals", "MaxIter", "Display".  For a description of these options, see 'optimset'.

     On exit, the function returns X, the minimum point, and FVAL, the function value thereof.

     Example usages:

          fminsearch (@(x) (x(1)-5).^2+(x(2)-8).^4, [0;0])

 -- Function File: fminunc (FCN, X0)
 -- Function File: fminunc (FCN, X0, OPTIONS)
 -- Function File: [X, FVAL, INFO, OUTPUT, GRAD, HESS] = fminunc (FCN, ...)
     Solve an unconstrained optimization problem defined by the function FCN.

     FCN should accept a vector (array) defining the unknown variables, and return the objective function value, optionally with gradient.  'fminunc' attempts to determine a vector X such that 'FCN (X)' is a local minimum.

     X0 determines a starting guess.  The shape of X0 is preserved in all calls to FCN, but otherwise is treated as a column vector.

     OPTIONS is a structure specifying additional options.  Currently, 'fminunc' recognizes these options: "FunValCheck", "OutputFcn", "TolX", "TolFun", "MaxIter", "MaxFunEvals", "GradObj", "FinDiffType", "TypicalX", "AutoScaling".

     If "GradObj" is "on", it specifies that FCN, when called with 2 output arguments, also returns the Jacobian matrix of partial first derivatives at the requested point.  'TolX' specifies the termination tolerance for the unknown variables X, while 'TolFun' is a tolerance for the objective function value FVAL.  The default is '1e-7' for both options.

     For a description of the other options, see 'optimset'.

     On return, X is the location of the minimum and FVAL contains the value of the objective function at X.

     INFO may be one of the following values:

     1
          Converged to a solution point.  Relative gradient error is less than specified by 'TolFun'.

     2
          Last relative step size was less than 'TolX'.

     3
          Last relative change in function value was less than 'TolFun'.

     0
          Iteration limit exceeded--either maximum number of algorithm iterations 'MaxIter' or maximum number of function evaluations 'MaxFunEvals'.

     -1
          Algorithm terminated by 'OutputFcn'.

     -3
          The trust region radius became excessively small.

     Optionally, 'fminunc' can return a structure with convergence statistics (OUTPUT), the output gradient (GRAD) at the solution X, and approximate Hessian (HESS) at the solution X.

     Application Notes: If have only a single nonlinear equation of one variable then using 'fminbnd' is usually a better choice.

     The algorithm used by 'fminsearch' is a gradient search which depends on the objective function being differentiable.  If the function has discontinuities it may be better to use a derivative-free algorithm such as 'fminsearch'.

 -- Function File: fsolve (FCN, X0, OPTIONS)
 -- Function File: [X, FVEC, INFO, OUTPUT, FJAC] = fsolve (FCN, ...)
     Solve a system of nonlinear equations defined by the function FCN.

     FCN should accept a vector (array) defining the unknown variables, and return a vector of left-hand sides of the equations.  Right-hand sides are defined to be zeros.  In other words, this function attempts to determine a vector X such that 'FCN (X)' gives (approximately) all zeros.

     X0 determines a starting guess.  The shape of X0 is preserved in all calls to FCN, but otherwise it is treated as a column vector.

     OPTIONS is a structure specifying additional options.  Currently, 'fsolve' recognizes these options: "FunValCheck", "OutputFcn", "TolX", "TolFun", "MaxIter", "MaxFunEvals", "Jacobian", "Updating", "ComplexEqn" "TypicalX", "AutoScaling" and "FinDiffType".

     If "Jacobian" is "on", it specifies that FCN, called with 2 output arguments also returns the Jacobian matrix of right-hand sides at the requested point.  "TolX" specifies the termination tolerance in the unknown variables, while "TolFun" is a tolerance for equations.  Default is '1e-7' for both "TolX" and "TolFun".

     If "AutoScaling" is on, the variables will be automatically scaled according to the column norms of the (estimated) Jacobian.  As a result, TolF becomes scaling-independent.  By default, this option is off because it may sometimes deliver unexpected (though mathematically correct) results.

     If "Updating" is "on", the function will attempt to use Broyden updates to update the Jacobian, in order to reduce the amount of Jacobian calculations.  If your user function always calculates the Jacobian (regardless of number of output arguments) then this option provides no advantage and should be set to false.

     "ComplexEqn" is "on", 'fsolve' will attempt to solve complex equations in complex variables, assuming that the equations possess a complex derivative (i.e., are holomorphic).  If this is not what you want, you should unpack the real and imaginary parts of the system to get a real system.

     For description of the other options, see 'optimset'.

     On return, FVAL contains the value of the function FCN evaluated at X.

     INFO may be one of the following values:

     1
          Converged to a solution point.  Relative residual error is less than specified by TolFun.

     2
          Last relative step size was less that TolX.

     3
          Last relative decrease in residual was less than TolF.

     0
          Iteration limit exceeded.

     -3
          The trust region radius became excessively small.

     Note: If you only have a single nonlinear equation of one variable, using 'fzero' is usually a much better idea.

     Note about user-supplied Jacobians: As an inherent property of the algorithm, a Jacobian is always requested for a solution vector whose residual vector is already known, and it is the last accepted successful step.  Often this will be one of the last two calls, but not always.  If the savings by reusing intermediate results from residual calculation in Jacobian calculation are significant, the best strategy is to employ OutputFcn: After a vector is evaluated for residuals, if OutputFcn is called with that vector, then the intermediate results should be saved for future Jacobian evaluation, and should be kept until a Jacobian evaluation is requested or until OutputFcn is called with a different vector, in which case they should be dropped in favor of this most recent vector.  A short example how this can be achieved follows:

          function [fvec, fjac] = user_func (x, optimvalues, state)
          persistent sav = [], sav0 = [];
          if (nargin == 1)
            ## evaluation call
            if (nargout == 1)
              sav0.x = x; # mark saved vector
              ## calculate fvec, save results to sav0.
            elseif (nargout == 2)
              ## calculate fjac using sav.
            endif
          else
            ## outputfcn call.
            if (all (x == sav0.x))
              sav = sav0;
            endif
            ## maybe output iteration status, etc.
          endif
          endfunction

          ## ...

          fsolve (@user_func, x0, optimset ("OutputFcn", @user_func, ...))

 -- Function File: fzero (FUN, X0)
 -- Function File: fzero (FUN, X0, OPTIONS)
 -- Function File: [X, FVAL, INFO, OUTPUT] = fzero (...)
     Find a zero of a univariate function.

     FUN is a function handle, inline function, or string containing the name of the function to evaluate.

     X0 should be a two-element vector specifying two points which bracket a zero.  In other words, there must be a change in sign of the function between X0(1) and X0(2).  More mathematically, the following must hold

          sign (FUN(X0(1))) * sign (FUN(X0(2))) <= 0

     If X0 is a single scalar then several nearby and distant values are probed in an attempt to obtain a valid bracketing.  If this is not successful, the function fails.

     OPTIONS is a structure specifying additional options.  Currently, 'fzero' recognizes these options: "FunValCheck", "OutputFcn", "TolX", "MaxIter", "MaxFunEvals".  For a description of these options, see *note optimset: XREFoptimset.

     On exit, the function returns X, the approximate zero point and FVAL, the function value thereof.

     INFO is an exit flag that can have these values:

        * 1 The algorithm converged to a solution.

        * 0 Maximum number of iterations or function evaluations has been reached.

        * -1 The algorithm has been terminated from user output function.

        * -5 The algorithm may have converged to a singular point.

     OUTPUT is a structure containing runtime information about the 'fzero' algorithm.  Fields in the structure are:

        * iterations Number of iterations through loop.

        * nfev Number of function evaluations.

        * bracketx A two-element vector with the final bracketing of the zero along the x-axis.

        * brackety A two-element vector with the final bracketing of the zero along the y-axis.

     PARAM
          A structure containing the following parameters used to define the behavior of solver.  Missing elements in the structure take on default values, so you only need to set the elements that you wish to change from the default.

          Integer parameters:

          'msglev (default: 1)'
               Level of messages output by solver routines:

               0 ('GLP_MSG_OFF')
                    No output.

               1 ('GLP_MSG_ERR')
                    Error and warning messages only.

               2 ('GLP_MSG_ON')
                    Normal output.

               3 ('GLP_MSG_ALL')
                    Full output (includes informational messages).

          'scale (default: 16)'
               Scaling option.  The values can be combined with the bitwise OR operator and may be the following:

               1 ('GLP_SF_GM')
                    Geometric mean scaling.

               16 ('GLP_SF_EQ')
                    Equilibration scaling.

               32 ('GLP_SF_2N')

               64 ('GLP_SF_SKIP')
                    Skip if problem is well scaled.

               Alternatively, a value of 128 ('GLP_SF_AUTO') may be also specified, in which case the routine chooses the scaling options automatically.

          'dual (default: 1)'
               Simplex method option:

               1 ('GLP_PRIMAL')

               17 ('GLP_PT_STD')
                    Textbook pricing.

               34 ('GLP_PT_PSE')

          'itlim (default: intmax)'
               Simplex iterations limit.  It is decreased by one each time when one simplex iteration has been performed, and reaching zero value signals the solver to stop the search.

          'outfrq (default: 200)'
               Output frequency, in iterations.  This parameter specifies how frequently the solver sends information about the solution to the standard output.

          'branch (default: 4)'
               Branching technique option (for MIP only):

     Create options structure for optimization functions.

     When called without any input or output arguments, 'optimset' prints a list of all valid optimization parameters.

     When called with one output and no inputs, return an options structure with all valid option parameters initialized to '[]'.

     When called with a list of parameter/value pairs, return an options structure with only the named parameters initialized.

     When the first input is an existing options structure OLD, the values are updated from either the PAR/VAL list or from the options structure NEW.

     Valid parameters are:

     AutoScaling

     ComplexEqn

     Display
          Request verbose display of results from optimizations.  Values are:

          "off" [default]
               No display.

          "iter"
               Display intermediate results for every loop iteration.

          "final"
               Display the result of the final loop iteration.

          "notify"
               Display the result of the final loop iteration if the function has failed to converge.

     FinDiffType

     FunValCheck
          When enabled, display an error if the objective function returns an invalid value (a complex number, NaN, or Inf).  Must be set to "on" or "off" [default].  Note: the functions 'fzero' and 'fminbnd' correctly handle Inf values and only complex values or NaN will cause an error in this case.

     GradObj
          When set to "on", the function to be minimized must return a second argument which is the gradient, or first derivative, of the function at the point X.  If set to "off" [default], the gradient is computed via finite differences.

     Jacobian
          When set to "on", the function to be minimized must return a second argument which is the Jacobian, or first derivative, of the function at the point X.  If set to "off" [default], the Jacobian is computed via finite differences.

     MaxFunEvals
          Maximum number of function evaluations before optimization stops.  Must be a positive integer.

     MaxIter
          Maximum number of algorithm iterations before optimization stops.  Must be a positive integer.

     OutputFcn
          A user-defined function executed once per algorithm iteration.

     TolFun
          Termination criterion for the function output.  If the difference in the calculated objective function between one algorithm iteration and the next is less than 'TolFun' the optimization stops.  Must be a positive scalar.

     TolX
          Termination criterion for the function input.  If the difference in X, the current search point, between one algorithm iteration and the next is less than 'TolX' the optimization stops.  Must be a positive scalar.

     Minimize an objective function using sequential quadratic programming (SQP).

     Solve the nonlinear program

          min phi (x)
           x

     subject to

          g(x)  = 0
          h(x) >= 0
          lb <= x <= ub

     using a sequential quadratic programming method.

     The first argument is the initial guess for the vector X0.

     The second argument is a function handle pointing to the objective function PHI.  The objective function must accept one vector argument and return a scalar.

     The second argument may also be a 2- or 3-element cell array of function handles.  The first element should point to the objective function, the second should point to a function that computes the gradient of the objective function, and the third should point to a function that computes the Hessian of the objective function.  If the gradient function is not supplied, the gradient is computed by finite differences.  If the Hessian function is not supplied, a BFGS update formula is used to approximate the Hessian.

     When supplied, the gradient function 'PHI{2}' must accept one vector argument and return a vector.  When supplied, the Hessian function 'PHI{3}' must accept one vector argument and return a matrix.

     The third and fourth arguments G and H are function handles pointing to functions that compute the equality constraints and the inequality constraints, respectively.  If the problem does not have equality (or inequality) constraints, then use an empty matrix ([]) for G (or H).  When supplied, these equality and inequality constraint functions must accept one vector argument and return a vector.

     The third and fourth arguments may also be 2-element cell arrays of function handles.  The first element should point to the constraint function and the second should point to a function that computes the gradient of the constraint function:

                      [ d f(x)   d f(x)        d f(x) ]
          transpose ( [ ------   -----   ...   ------ ] )
                      [  dx_1     dx_2          dx_N  ]

     The fifth and sixth arguments, LB and UB, contain lower and upper bounds on X.  These must be consistent with the equality and inequality constraints G and H.  If the arguments are vectors then X(i) is bound by LB(i) and UB(i).  A bound can also be a scalar in which case all elements of X will share the same bound.  If only one bound (lb, ub) is specified then the other will default to (-REALMAX, +REALMAX).

     The seventh argument MAXITER specifies the maximum number of iterations.  The default value is 100.

     The eighth argument TOL specifies the tolerance for the stopping criteria.  The default value is 'sqrt (eps)'.

     The value returned in INFO may be one of the following:

     101
          The algorithm terminated normally.  All constraints meet the specified tolerance.

     102
          The BFGS update failed.

     103
          The maximum number of iterations was reached.

     104
          The stepsize has become too small, i.e., delta X, is less than 'TOL * norm (x)'.

     An example of calling 'sqp':

          function r = g (x)
            r = [ sumsq(x)-10;
                  x(2)*x(3)-5*x(4)*x(5);
                  x(1)^3+x(2)^3+1 ];
          endfunction

          function obj = phi (x)
            obj = exp (prod (x)) - 0.5*(x(1)^3+x(2)^3+1)^2;

 -- Function File: savepath ()
 -- Function File: savepath (FILE)
 -- Function File: STATUS = savepath (...)
     Save the unique portion of the current function search path that is not set during Octave's initialization process to FILE.

     If FILE is omitted, Octave looks in the current directory for a project-specific '.octaverc' file in which to save the path information.  If no such file is present then the user's configuration file '~/.octaverc' is used.

     If successful, 'savepath' returns 0.

     The 'savepath' function makes it simple to customize a user's configuration file to restore the working paths necessary for a particular instance of Octave.  Assuming no filename is specified, Octave will automatically restore the saved directory paths from the appropriate '.octaverc' file when starting up.  If a filename has been specified then the paths may be restored manually by calling 'source FILE'.

 -- Command: pkg COMMAND PKG_NAME
 -- Command: pkg COMMAND OPTION PKG_NAME
     Manage packages (groups of add-on functions) for Octave.

     Different actions are available depending on the value of COMMAND.

     Available commands:

     'install'
          Install named packages.  For example,

               pkg install image-1.0.0.tar.gz

          installs the package found in the file 'image-1.0.0.tar.gz'.

          The OPTION variable can contain options that affect the manner in which a package is installed.  These options can be one or more of

          '-nodeps'
               The package manager will disable dependency checking.  With this option it is possible to install a package even when it depends on another package which is not installed on the system.  *Use this option with care.*

          '-noauto'
               The package manager will not automatically load the installed package when starting Octave.  This overrides any setting within the package.

          '-auto'
               The package manager will automatically load the installed package when starting Octave.  This overrides any setting within the package.

          '-local'
               A local installation (package available only to current user) is forced, even if the user has system privileges.

          '-global'
               A global installation (package available to all users) is forced, even if the user doesn't normally have system privileges.

          '-forge'
               Install a package directly from the Octave-Forge repository.  This requires an internet connection and the cURL library.

          '-verbose'
               The package manager will print the output of all commands as they are performed.

     'update'
          Check installed Octave-Forge packages against repository and update any outdated items.  This requires an internet connection and the cURL library.  Usage:

               pkg update

     'uninstall'
          Uninstall named packages.  For example,

               pkg uninstall image

          removes the 'image' package from the system.  If another installed package depends on the 'image' package an error will be issued.  The package can be uninstalled anyway by using the '-nodeps' option.

     'load'
          Add named packages to the path.  After loading a package it is possible to use the functions provided by the package.  For example,

               pkg load image

          adds the 'image' package to the path.  It is possible to load all installed packages at once with the keyword 'all'.  Usage:

               pkg load all

     'unload'
          Remove named packages from the path.  After unloading a package it is no longer possible to use the functions provided by the package.  It is possible to unload all installed packages at once with the keyword 'all'.  Usage:

               pkg unload all

     'list'
          Show the list of currently installed packages.  For example,

               pkg list

          will produce a short report with the package name, version, and installation directory for each installed package.  Supply a package name to limit reporting to a particular package.  For example:

               pkg list image

          If a single return argument is requested then 'pkg' returns a cell array where each element is a structure with information on a single package.

               installed_packages = pkg ("list")

          If two output arguments are requested 'pkg' splits the list of installed packages into those which were installed by the current user, and those which were installed by the system administrator.

               [user_packages, system_packages] = pkg ("list")

          The "-forge" option lists packages available at the Octave-Forge repository.  This requires an internet connection and the cURL library.  For example:

               oct_forge_pkgs = pkg ("list", "-forge")

     'describe'
          Show a short description of the named installed packages, with the option "-verbose" also list functions provided by the package.  For example,

               pkg describe -verbose all

          will describe all installed packages and the functions they provide.  If one output is requested a cell of structure containing the description and list of functions of each package is returned as output rather than printed on screen:

               desc = pkg ("describe", "secs1d", "image")

          If any of the requested packages is not installed, 'pkg' returns an error, unless a second output is requested:

               [desc, flag] = pkg ("describe", "secs1d", "image")

          FLAG will take one of the values "Not installed", "Loaded", or "Not loaded" for each of the named packages.

     'prefix'
          Set the installation prefix directory.  For example,

               pkg prefix ~/my_octave_packages

          sets the installation prefix to '~/my_octave_packages'.  Packages will be installed in this directory.

          It is possible to get the current installation prefix by requesting an output argument.  For example:

               pfx = pkg ("prefix")

          The location in which to install the architecture dependent files can be independently specified with an addition argument.  For example:

               pkg prefix ~/my_octave_packages ~/my_arch_dep_pkgs

     'local_list'
          Set the file in which to look for information on locally installed packages.  Locally installed packages are those that are available only to the current user.  For example:

               pkg local_list ~/.octave_packages

          It is possible to get the current value of local_list with the following

               pkg local_list

     'global_list'
          Set the file in which to look for information on globally installed packages.  Globally installed packages are those that are available to all users.  For example:

               pkg global_list /usr/share/octave/octave_packages

          It is possible to get the current value of global_list with the following

               pkg global_list

     'build'
          Build a binary form of a package or packages.  The binary file produced will itself be an Octave package that can be installed normally with 'pkg'.  The form of the command to build a binary package is

               pkg build builddir image-1.0.0.tar.gz ...

          where 'builddir' is the name of a directory where the temporary installation will be produced and the binary packages will be found.  The options '-verbose' and '-nodeps' are respected, while all other options are ignored.

     'rebuild'
          Rebuild the package database from the installed directories.  This can be used in cases where the package database has been corrupted.  It can also take the '-auto' and '-noauto' options to allow the autoloading state of a package to be changed.  For example,

               pkg rebuild -noauto image

          will remove the autoloading status of the image package.

 -- Function File: annotation (HF, ...)
 -- Function File: H = annotation (...)
     Draw annotations to emphasize parts of a figure.

     You may build a default annotation by specifying only the TYPE of the annotation.

     Otherwise you can select the type of annotation and then set its position using either X and Y coordinates for line-based annotations or a position vector POS for others.  In either case, coordinates are interpreted using the "units" property of the annotation object.  The default is "normalized", which means the lower left hand corner of the figure has coordinates '[0 0]' and the upper right hand corner '[1 1]'.

     If the first argument HF is a figure handle, then plot into this figure, rather than the current figure returned by 'gcf'.

     Further arguments can be provided in the form of PROP/VAL pairs to customize the annotation appearance.

     The optional return value H is a graphics handle to the created annotation object.  This can be used with the 'set' function to customize an existing annotation object.

     All annotation objects share two properties:

        * "units": the units in which coordinates are interpreted.
          Its value may be one of "centimeters" | "characters" | "inches" | "{normalized}" | "pixels" | "points".

        * "position": a four-element vector [x0 y0 width height].
          The vector specifies the coordinates (x0,y0) of the origin of the annotation object, its width, and its height.  The width and height may be negative, depending on the orientation of the object.

     Valid annotation types and their specific properties are described below:

     "line"
          Constructs a line.  X and Y must be two-element vectors specifying the x and y coordinates of the two ends of the line.

          The line can be customized using "linewidth", "linestyle", and "color" properties the same way as for 'line' objects.

     "arrow"
          Construct an arrow.  The second point in vectors X and Y specifies the arrowhead coordinates.

          Besides line properties, the arrowhead can be customized using "headlength", "headwidth", and "headstyle" properties.  Supported values for "headstyle" property are: ["diamond" | "ellipse" | "plain" | "rectangle" | "vback1" | "{vback2}" | "vback3"]

     "doublearrow"
          Construct a double arrow.  Vectors X and Y specify the arrowhead coordinates.

          The line and the arrowhead can be customized as for arrow annotations, but some property names are duplicated: "head1length"/"head2length", "head1width"/"head2width", etc.  The index 1 marks the properties of the arrowhead at the first point in X and Y coordinates.

     "textarrow"
          Construct an arrow with a text label at the opposite end from the arrowhead.

          Use the "string" property to change the text string.  The line and the arrowhead can be customized as for arrow annotations, and the text can be customized using the same properties as 'text' graphics objects.  Note, however, that some text property names are prefixed with "text" to distinguish them from arrow properties: "textbackgroundcolor", "textcolor", "textedgecolor", "textlinewidth", "textmargin", "textrotation".

     "textbox"
          Construct a box with text inside.  POS specifies the "position" property of the annotation.

          Use the "string" property to change the text string.  You may use "backgroundcolor", "edgecolor", "linestyle", and "linewidth" properties to customize the box background color and edge appearance.  A limited set of 'text' objects properties are also available; Besides "font..." properties, you may also use "horizontalalignment" and "verticalalignment" to position the text inside the box.

          Finally, the "fitboxtotext" property controls the actual extent of the box.  If "on" (the default) the box limits are fitted to the text extent.

     "rectangle"
          Construct a rectangle.  POS specifies the "position" property of the annotation.

          You may use "facecolor", "color", "linestyle", and "linewidth" properties to customize the rectangle background color and edge appearance.

     "ellipse"
          Construct an ellipse.  POS specifies the "position" property of the annotation.

          See "rectangle" annotations for customization.

 -- Function File: axis (OPTION)
 -- Function File: axis (..., OPTION)
 -- Function File: axis (HAX, ...)
 -- Function File: LIMITS = axis ()
     Set axis limits and appearance.

     The argument LIMITS should be a 2-, 4-, or 6-element vector.  The first and second elements specify the lower and upper limits for the x-axis.  The third and fourth specify the limits for the y-axis, and the fifth and sixth specify the limits for the z-axis.  The special values -Inf and Inf may be used to indicate that the limit should automatically be computed based on the data in the axis.

     Without any arguments, 'axis' turns autoscaling on.

     With one output argument, 'LIMITS = axis' returns the current axis limits.

     The vector argument specifying limits is optional, and additional string arguments may be used to specify various axis properties.  For example,

          axis ([1, 2, 3, 4], "square");

     forces a square aspect ratio, and

          axis ("tic", "labely");

     turns tic marks on for all axes and tic mark labels on for the y-axis only.

     The following options control the aspect ratio of the axes.

     "square"
          Force a square aspect ratio.

     "equal"
          Force x distance to equal y-distance.

     "normal"
          Restore default aspect ratio.

     The following options control the way axis limits are interpreted.

     "auto"
          Set the specified axes to have nice limits around the data or all if no axes are specified.

     "manual"
          Fix the current axes limits.

     "tight"
          Fix axes to the limits of the data.

     "image"
          Equivalent to "tight" and "equal".

     The following options affect the appearance of tic marks.

     "on"
          Turn tic marks and labels on for all axes.

     "off"
          Turn tic marks off for all axes.

     "tic[xyz]"
          Turn tic marks on for all axes, or turn them on for the specified axes and off for the remainder.

     "label[xyz]"
          Turn tic labels on for all axes, or turn them on for the specified axes and off for the remainder.

     "nolabel"
          Turn tic labels off for all axes.

     Note, if there are no tic marks for an axis, there can be no labels.

     The following options affect the direction of increasing values on the axes.

     "ij"
          Reverse y-axis, so lower values are nearer the top.

     "xy"
          Restore y-axis, so higher values are nearer the top.

     If the first argument HAX is an axes handle, then operate on this axes rather than the current axes returned by 'gca'.

     Query or set color axis limits for plots.

     The limits argument should be a 2-element vector specifying the lower and upper limits to assign to the first and last value in the colormap.  Data values outside this range are clamped to the first and last colormap entries.

     If the "auto" option is given then automatic colormap limits are applied.  The automatic algorithm sets CMIN to the minimum data value and CMAX to the maximum data value.  If "manual" is specified then the "climmode" property is set to "manual" and the numeric values in the "clim" property are used for limits.

     If the first argument HAX is an axes handle, then operate on this axis rather than the current axes returned by 'gca'.

     Called without arguments the current color axis limits are returned.

     Add labels to the contours of a contour plot.

     The contour levels are specified by the contour matrix C which is returned by 'contour', 'contourc', 'contourf', and 'contour3'.  Contour labels are rotated to match the local line orientation and centered on the line.  The position of labels along the contour line is chosen randomly.

     If the argument H is a handle to a contour group object, then label this plot rather than the one in the current axes returned by 'gca'.

     By default, all contours are labeled.  However, the contours to label can be specified by the vector V.  If the "manual" argument is given then the contours to label can be selected with the mouse.

     Additional property/value pairs that are valid properties of text objects can be given and are passed to the underlying text objects.  Moreover, the contour group property "LabelSpacing" is available which determines the spacing between labels on a contour to be specified.  The default is 144 points, or 2 inches.

     The optional return value H is a vector of graphics handles to the text objects representing each label.  The "userdata" property of the text objects contains the numerical value of the contour label.

     An example of the use of 'clabel' is

          [c, h] = contour (peaks (), -4 : 6);
          clabel (c, h, -4:2:6, "fontsize", 12);

     Control the display of plot grid lines.

     The function state input may be either "on" or "off".  If it is omitted, the current grid state is toggled.

     When the first argument is "minor" all subsequent commands modify the minor grid rather than the major grid.

     If the first argument HAX is an axes handle, then operate on this axis rather than the current axes returned by 'gca'.

     To control the grid lines for an individual axis use the 'set' function.  For example:

          set (gca, "ygrid", "on");

     Place text on the current figure using the mouse.

     The text is defined by the string S.  If S is a cell string organized as a row vector then each string of the cell array is written to a separate line.  If S is organized as a column vector then one string element of the cell array is placed for every mouse click.

     Optional property/value pairs are passed directly to the underlying text objects.

     The optional return value H is a graphics handle to the created text object(s).

     Control mesh hidden line removal.

     When called with no argument the hidden line removal state is toggled.

     When called with one of the modes "on" or "off" the state is set accordingly.

     The optional output argument MODE is the current state.

     Hidden Line Removal determines what graphic objects behind a mesh plot are visible.  The default is for the mesh to be opaque and lines behind the mesh are not visible.  If hidden line removal is turned off then objects behind the mesh can be seen through the faces (openings) of the mesh, although the mesh grid lines are still opaque.

     "left"
          Place label text to the left of the keys

     "off"
          Delete the legend object

     The optional output values are

     HLEG
          The graphics handle of the legend object.

     HLEG_OBJ
          Graphics handles to the text and line objects which make up the legend.

     HPLOT
          Graphics handles to the plot objects which were used in making the legend.

     LABELS
          A cell array of strings of the labels in the legend.

     The legend label text is either provided in the call to 'legend' or is taken from the DisplayName property of graphics objects.  If no labels or DisplayNames are available, then the label text is simply "data1", "data2", ..., "dataN".

     Implementation Note: A legend is implemented as an additional axes object of the current figure with the "tag" set to "legend".  Properties of the legend object may be manipulated directly by using 'set'.

 -- Function File: ORIENTATION = orient ()
 -- Function File: ORIENTATION = orient (HFIG)
     Query or set the print orientation for figure HFIG.

     Valid values for ORIENTATION are "portrait", "landscape", and "tall".

     The "landscape" option changes the orientation so the plot width is larger than the plot height.  The "paperposition" is also modified so that the plot fills the page, while leaving a 0.25 inch border.

     The "tall" option sets the orientation to "portrait" and fills the page with the plot, while leaving a 0.25 inch border.

     The "portrait" option (default) changes the orientation so the plot height is larger than the plot width.  It also restores the default "paperposition" property.

     When called with no arguments, return the current print orientation.

     If the argument HFIG is omitted, then operate on the current figure returned by 'gcf'.

     Area plot of the columns of Y.

     This plot shows the contributions of each column value to the row sum.  It is functionally similar to 'plot (X, cumsum (Y, 2))', except that the area under the curve is shaded.

     If the X argument is omitted it defaults to '1:rows (Y)'.  A value LVL can be defined that determines where the base level of the shading under the curve should be defined.  The default level is 0.

     Additional property/value pairs are passed directly to the underlying patch object.

     If the first argument HAX is an axes handle, then plot into this axis, rather than the current axes returned by 'gca'.

     The optional return value H is a graphics handle to the hggroup object comprising the area patch objects.  The "BaseValue" property of the hggroup can be used to adjust the level where shading begins.

     Example: Verify identity sin^2 + cos^2 = 1

          t = linspace (0, 2*pi, 100)';

     Produce a horizontal bar graph from two vectors of X-Y data.

     If only one argument is given, it is taken as a vector of Y values and the X coordinates are the range '1:numel (Y)'.

     The optional input W controls the width of the bars.  A value of 1.0 will cause each bar to exactly touch any adjacent bars.  The default width is 0.8.

     If Y is a matrix, then each column of Y is taken to be a separate bar graph plotted on the same graph.  By default the columns are plotted side-by-side.  This behavior can be changed by the STYLE argument which can take the following values:

     "grouped" (default)
          Side-by-side bars with a gap between bars and centered over the Y-coordinate.

     "stacked"
          Bars are stacked so that each Y value has a single bar composed of multiple segments.

     "hist"
          Side-by-side bars with no gap between bars and centered over the Y-coordinate.

     "histc"

     Optional property/value pairs are passed directly to the underlying patch objects.

     If the first argument HAX is an axes handle, then plot into this axis, rather than the current axes returned by 'gca'.

     The optional return value H is a vector of handles to the created "bar series" hggroups with one handle per column of the variable Y.  This series makes it possible to change a common element in one bar series object and have the change reflected in the other "bar series".  For example,

          h = bar (rand (5, 10));
          set (h(1), "basevalue", 0.5);

     changes the position on the base of all of the bar series.

     The following example modifies the face and edge colors using property/value pairs.

          bar (randn (1, 100), "facecolor", "r", "edgecolor", "b");

     The color of the bars is taken from the figure's colormap, such that

          bar (rand (10, 3));
          colormap (summer (64));

     will change the colors used for the bars.  The color of bars can also be set manually using the "facecolor" property as shown below.

          h = bar (rand (10, 3));
          set (h(1), "facecolor", "r")
          set (h(2), "facecolor", "g")

     Add a colorbar to the current axes.

     A colorbar displays the current colormap along with numerical rulings so that the color scale can be interpreted.

     The optional input LOC determines the location of the colorbar.  Valid values for LOC are

     "EastOutside"
          Place the colorbar outside the plot to the right.  This is the default.

     "East"
          Place the colorbar inside the plot to the right.

     "WestOutside"
          Place the colorbar outside the plot to the left.

     "West"
          Place the colorbar inside the plot to the left.

     "NorthOutside"
          Place the colorbar above the plot.

     "North"
          Place the colorbar at the top of the plot.

     "SouthOutside"
          Place the colorbar under the plot.

     "South"
          Place the colorbar at the bottom of the plot.

     To remove a colorbar from a plot use any one of the following keywords for the DELETE_OPTION: "delete", "hide", "off".

     If the argument "peer" is given, then the following argument is treated as the axes handle in which to add the colorbar.  Alternatively, If the first argument HAX is an axes handle, then the colorbar is added to this axis, rather than the current axes returned by 'gca'.

     If the first argument HCB is a handle to a colorbar object, then operate on this colorbar directly.

     Additional property/value pairs are passed directly to the underlying axes object.

     The optional return value H is a graphics handle to the created colorbar object.

     Implementation Note: A colorbar is created as an additional axes to the current figure with the "tag" property set to "colorbar".  The created axes object has the extra property "location" which controls the positioning of the colorbar.

     Create a 3-D contour plot.

     'contour3' plots level curves (contour lines) of the matrix Z at a Z level corresponding to each contour.  This is in contrast to 'contour' which plots all of the contour lines at the same Z level and produces a 2-D plot.

     The level curves are taken from the contour matrix C computed by 'contourc' for the same arguments; see the latter for their interpretation.

     The appearance of contour lines can be defined with a line style STYLE in the same manner as 'plot'.  Only line style and color are used; Any markers defined by STYLE are ignored.

     If the first argument HAX is an axes handle, then plot into this axis, rather than the current axes returned by 'gca'.

     The optional output C are the contour levels in 'contourc' format.

     The optional return value H is a graphics handle to the hggroup comprising the contour lines.

     Compute contour lines (isolines of constant Z value).

     The matrix Z contains height values above the rectangular grid determined by X and Y.  If only a single input Z is provided then X is taken to be '1:rows (Z)' and Y is taken to be '1:columns (Z)'.

     The optional input VN is either a scalar denoting the number of contour lines to compute or a vector containing the Z values where lines will be computed.  When VN is a vector the number of contour lines is 'numel (VN)'.  However, to compute a single contour line at a given value use 'VN = [val, val]'.  If VN is omitted it defaults to 10.

     The return value C is a 2xN matrix containing the contour lines in the following format

          C = [lev1, x1, x2, ..., levn, x1, x2, ...
               len1, y1, y2, ..., lenn, y1, y2, ...]

     in which contour line N has a level (height) of LEVN and length of LENN.

     Create a 2-D plot with errorbars.

     Many different combinations of arguments are possible.  The simplest form is

          errorbar (Y, EY)

     where the first argument is taken as the set of Y coordinates, the second argument EY are the errors around the Y values, and the X coordinates are taken to be the indices of the elements ('1:numel (Y)').

     The general form of the function is

          errorbar (X, Y, ERR1, ..., FMT, ...)

     After the X and Y arguments there can be 1, 2, or 4 parameters specifying the error values depending on the nature of the error values and the plot format FMT.

     ERR (scalar)
          When the error is a scalar all points share the same error value.  The errorbars are symmetric and are drawn from DATA-ERR to DATA+ERR.  The FMT argument determines whether ERR is in the x-direction, y-direction (default), or both.

     ERR (vector or matrix)
          Each data point has a particular error value.  The errorbars are symmetric and are drawn from DATA(n)-ERR(n) to DATA(n)+ERR(n).

     LERR, UERR (scalar)
          The errors have a single low-side value and a single upper-side value.  The errorbars are not symmetric and are drawn from DATA-LERR to DATA+UERR.

     LERR, UERR (vector or matrix)
          Each data point has a low-side error and an upper-side error.  The errorbars are not symmetric and are drawn from DATA(n)-LERR(n) to DATA(n)+UERR(n).

     Any number of data sets (X1,Y1, X2,Y2, ...) may appear as long as they are separated by a format string FMT.

     If Y is a matrix, X and the error parameters must also be matrices having the same dimensions.  The columns of Y are plotted versus the corresponding columns of X and errorbars are taken from the corresponding columns of the error parameters.

     If FMT is missing, the yerrorbars ("~") plot style is assumed.

     If the FMT argument is supplied then it is interpreted, as in normal plots, to specify the line style, marker, and color.  In addition, FMT may include an errorbar style which *must precede* the ordinary format codes.  The following errorbar styles are supported:

     '~'
          Set yerrorbars plot style (default).

     '>'
          Set xerrorbars plot style.

     '~>'
          Set xyerrorbars plot style.

     '#~'
          Set yboxes plot style.

     '#'
          Set xboxes plot style.

     '#~>'
          Set xyboxes plot style.

     If the first argument HAX is an axes handle, then plot into this axis, rather than the current axes returned by 'gca'.

     The optional return value H is a handle to the hggroup object representing the data plot and errorbars.

     Note: For compatibility with MATLAB a line is drawn through all data points.  However, most scientific errorbar plots are a scatter plot of points with errorbars.  To accomplish this, add a marker style to the FMT argument such as ".".  Alternatively, remove the line by modifying the returned graphic handle with 'set (h, "linestyle", "none")'.

     Examples:

          errorbar (X, Y, EX, ">.r")

     produces an xerrorbar plot of Y versus X with X errorbars drawn from X-EX to X+EX.  The marker "."  is used so no connecting line is drawn and the errorbars appear in red.

          errorbar (X, Y1, EY, "~",
                    X, Y2, LY, UY)

     produces yerrorbar plots with Y1 and Y2 versus X.  Errorbars for Y1 are drawn from Y1-EY to Y1+EY, errorbars for Y2 from Y2-LY to Y2+UY.

          errorbar (X, Y, LX, UX,
                    LY, UY, "~>")

     produces an xyerrorbar plot of Y versus X in which X errorbars are drawn from X-LX to X+UX and Y errorbars from Y-LY to Y+UY.

     Create one or more filled 2-D polygons.

     The inputs X and Y are the coordinates of the polygon vertices.  If the inputs are matrices then the rows represent different vertices and each column produces a different polygon.  'fill' will close any open polygons before plotting.

     The input C determines the color of the polygon.  The simplest form is a single color specification such as a 'plot' format or an RGB-triple.  In this case the polygon(s) will have one unique color.  If C is a vector or matrix then the color data is first scaled using 'caxis' and then indexed into the current colormap.  A row vector will color each polygon (a column from matrices X and Y) with a single computed color.  A matrix C of the same size as X and Y will compute the color of each vertex and then interpolate the face color between the vertices.

     Multiple property/value pairs for the underlying patch object may be specified, but they must appear in pairs.

     If the first argument HAX is an axes handle, then plot into this axis, rather than the current axes returned by 'gca'.

     The optional return value H is a vector of graphics handles to the created patch objects.

     Plot a function FN within the range defined by LIMITS.

     FN is a function handle, inline function, or string containing the name of the function to evaluate.

     The limits of the plot are of the form '[XLO, XHI]' or '[XLO, XHI, YLO, YHI]'.

     The next three arguments are all optional and any number of them may be given in any order.

     TOL is the relative tolerance to use for the plot and defaults to 2e-3 (.2%).

     N is the minimum number of points to use.  When N is specified, the maximum stepsize will be 'XHI - XLO / N'.  More than N points may still be used in order to meet the relative tolerance requirement.

     The FMT argument specifies the linestyle to be used by the plot command.

     If the first argument HAX is an axes handle, then plot into this axis, rather than the current axes returned by 'gca'.

     With no output arguments the results are immediately plotted.  With two output arguments the 2-D plot data is returned.  The data can subsequently be plotted manually with 'plot (X, Y)'.

     Example:

          fplot (@cos, [0, 2*pi])
          fplot ("[cos(x), sin(x)]", [0, 2*pi])

     Programming Notes:

     'fplot' works best with continuous functions.  Functions with discontinuities are unlikely to plot well.  This restriction may be removed in the future.

     'fplot' requires that the function accept and return a vector argument.  Consider this when writing user-defined functions and use '.*', './', etc.  See the function 'vectorize' for potentially converting inline or anonymous functions to vectorized versions.

     Produce histogram counts or plots.

     With one vector input argument, Y, plot a histogram of the values with 10 bins.  The range of the histogram bins is determined by the range of the data.  With one matrix input argument, Y, plot a histogram where each bin contains a bar per input column.

     Given a second vector argument, X, use that as the centers of the bins, with the width of the bins determined from the adjacent values in the vector.

     If scalar, the second argument, NBINS, defines the number of bins.

     If a third argument is provided, the histogram is normalized such that the sum of the bars is equal to NORM.

     Extreme values are lumped into the first and last bins.

     The histogram's appearance may be modified by specifying property/value pairs.  For example the face and edge color may be modified.

          hist (randn (1, 100), 25, "facecolor", "r", "edgecolor", "b");

     The histogram's colors also depend upon the current colormap.

          hist (rand (10, 3));
          colormap (summer ());

     If the first argument HAX is an axes handle, then plot into this axis, rather than the current axes returned by 'gca'.

     With two output arguments, produce the values NN (numbers of elements) and XX (bin centers) such that 'bar (XX, NN)' will plot the histogram.

     Compute isosurface colors.

     If called with one output argument and the first input argument C is a three-dimensional array that contains color values and the second input argument V keeps the vertices of a geometry then return a matrix CD with color data information for the geometry at computed points '[x, y, z] = meshgrid (1:l, 1:m, 1:n)'.  The output argument CD can be taken to manually set FaceVertexCData of a patch.

     If called with further input arguments X, Y and Z which are three-dimensional arrays of the same size than C then the color data is taken at those given points.  Instead of the color data C this function can also be called with RGB values R, G, B.  If input argumnets X, Y, Z are not given then again 'meshgrid' computed values are taken.

     Optionally, the patch handle P can be given as the last input argument to all variations of function calls instead of the vertices data V.  Finally, if no output argument is given then directly change the colors of a patch that is given by the patch handle P.

     For example:

          function [] = isofinish (p)
            set (gca, "PlotBoxAspectRatioMode", "manual", ...
                      "PlotBoxAspectRatio", [1 1 1]);

     Calculate normals to an isosurface.

     If called with one output argument and the first input argument VAL is a three-dimensional array that contains the data for an isosurface geometry and the second input argument V keeps the vertices of an isosurface then return the normals N in form of a matrix with the same size than V at computed points '[x, y, z] = meshgrid (1:l, 1:m, 1:n)'.  The output argument N can be taken to manually set VERTEXNORMALS of a patch.

     If called with further input arguments X, Y and Z which are three-dimensional arrays with the same size than VAL then the volume data is taken at those given points.  Instead of the vertices data V a patch handle P can be passed to this function.

     If given the string input argument "negate" as last input argument then compute the reverse vector normals of an isosurface geometry.

     If no output argument is given then directly redraw the patch that is given by the patch handle P.

     For example:

          function [] = isofinish (p)
            set (gca, "PlotBoxAspectRatioMode", "manual", ...
                      "PlotBoxAspectRatio", [1 1 1]);
            set (p, "VertexNormals", -get (p,"VertexNormals")); # Revert normals
            set (p, "FaceColor", "interp");
            ## set (p, "FaceLighting", "phong");
            ## light ("Position", [1 1 5]); # Available with JHandles

          c = abs ((x-.5).^2 + (y-.5).^2 + (z-.5).^2);

     Calculate isosurface of 3-D data.

     If called with one output argument and the first input argument VAL is a three-dimensional array that contains the data of an isosurface geometry and the second input argument ISO keeps the isovalue as a scalar value then return a structure array FV that contains the fields FACES and VERTICES at computed points '[x, y, z] = meshgrid (1:l, 1:m, 1:n)'.  The output argument FV can directly be taken as an input argument for the 'patch' function.

     If called with further input arguments X, Y and Z which are three-dimensional arrays with the same size than VAL then the volume data is taken at those given points.

     The string input argument "noshare" is only for compatibility and has no effect.  If given the string input argument "verbose" then print messages to the command line interface about the current progress.

     If called with the input argument COL which is a three-dimensional array of the same size than VAL then take those values for the interpolation of coloring the isosurface geometry.  Add the field FACEVERTEXCDATA to the structure array FV.

     If called with two or three output arguments then return the information about the faces F, vertices V and color data C as separate arrays instead of a single structure array.

     If called with no output argument then directly process the isosurface geometry with the 'patch' command.

     For example,

          [x, y, z] = meshgrid (1:5, 1:5, 1:5);
          val = rand (5, 5, 5);
          isosurface (x, y, z, val, .5);

     will directly draw a random isosurface geometry in a graphics window.  Another example for an isosurface geometry with different additional coloring

     Plot a 3-D wireframe mesh with underlying contour lines.

     The wireframe mesh is plotted using rectangles.  The vertices of the rectangles [X, Y] are typically the output of 'meshgrid'.  over a 2-D rectangular region in the x-y plane.  Z determines the height above the plane of each vertex.  If only a single Z matrix is given, then it is plotted over the meshgrid 'X = 1:columns (Z), Y = 1:rows (Z)'.  Thus, columns of Z correspond to different X values and rows of Z correspond to different Y values.

     The color of the mesh is computed by linearly scaling the Z values to fit the range of the current colormap.  Use 'caxis' and/or change the colormap to control the appearance.

     Optionally the color of the mesh can be specified independently of Z by supplying a color matrix, C.

     Any property/value pairs are passed directly to the underlying surface object.

     If the first argument HAX is an axes handle, then plot into this axis, rather than the current axes returned by 'gca'.

     The optional return value H is a 2-element vector with a graphics handle to the created surface object and to the created contour plot.

     The color of the mesh is computed by linearly scaling the Z values to fit the range of the current colormap.  Use 'caxis' and/or change the colormap to control the appearance.

     Optionally the color of the mesh can be specified independently of Z by supplying a color matrix, C.

     Any property/value pairs are passed directly to the underlying surface object.

     If the first argument HAX is an axes handle, then plot into this axis, rather than the current axes returned by 'gca'.

     The optional return value H is a graphics handle to the created surface object.

     Draw a Pareto chart.

     A Pareto chart is a bar graph that arranges information in such a way that priorities for process improvement can be established; It organizes and displays information to show the relative importance of data.  The chart is similar to the histogram or bar chart, except that the bars are arranged in decreasing magnitude from left to right along the x-axis.

     The fundamental idea (Pareto principle) behind the use of Pareto diagrams is that the majority of an effect is due to a small subset of the causes.  For quality improvement, the first few contributing causes (leftmost bars as presented on the diagram) to a problem usually account for the majority of the result.  Thus, targeting these "major causes" for elimination results in the most cost-effective improvement scheme.

     Typically only the magnitude data Y is present in which case X is taken to be the range '1 : length (Y)'.  If X is given it may be a string array, a cell array of strings, or a numerical vector.

     If the first argument HAX is an axes handle, then plot into this axis, rather than the current axes returned by 'gca'.

     The optional return value H is a 2-element vector with a graphics handle for the created bar plot and a second handle for the created line plot.

     An example of the use of 'pareto' is

          Cheese = {"Cheddar", "Swiss", "Camembert", ...
                    "Munster", "Stilton", "Blue"};
          Sold = [105, 30, 70, 10, 15, 20];
          pareto (Sold, Cheese);

     Create patch object in the current axes with vertices at locations (X, Y) and of color C.

     If the vertices are matrices of size MxN then each polygon patch has M vertices and a total of N polygons will be created.  If some polygons do not have M vertices use NaN to represent "no vertex".  If the Z input is present then 3-D patches will be created.

     The color argument C can take many forms.  To create polygons which all share a single color use a string value (e.g., "r" for red), a scalar value which is scaled by 'caxis' and indexed into the current colormap, or a 3-element RGB vector with the precise TrueColor.

     If C is a vector of length N then the ith polygon will have a color determined by scaling entry C(i) according to 'caxis' and then indexing into the current colormap.  More complicated coloring situations require directly manipulating patch property/value pairs.

     Instead of specifying polygons by matrices X and Y, it is possible to present a unique list of vertices and then a list of polygon faces created from those vertices.  In this case the "Vertices" matrix will be an Nx2 (2-D patch) or Nx3 (3-D patch).  The MxN "Faces" matrix describes M polygons having N vertices--each row describes a single polygon and each column entry is an index into the "Vertices" matrix to identify a vertex.  The patch object can be created by directly passing the property/value pairs "Vertices"/VERTS, "Faces"/FACES as inputs.

     A third input form is to create a structure FV with the fields "vertices", "faces", and optionally "facevertexcdata".

     If the first argument HAX is an axes handle, then plot into this axis, rather than the current axes returned by 'gca'.

     The optional return value H is a graphics handle to the created patch object.

     Implementation Note: Patches are highly configurable objects.  To truly customize them requires setting patch properties directly.  Useful patch properties are: "cdata", "edgecolor", "facecolor", "faces", "facevertexcdata".

     Produce a 2-D density plot.

     A 'pcolor' plot draws rectangles with colors from the matrix C over the two-dimensional region represented by the matrices X and Y.  X and Y are the coordinates of the mesh's vertices and are typically the output of 'meshgrid'.  If X and Y are vectors, then a typical vertex is (X(j), Y(i), C(i,j)).  Thus, columns of C correspond to different X values and rows of C correspond to different Y values.

     The values in C are scaled to span the range of the current colormap.  Limits may be placed on the color axis by the command 'caxis', or by setting the 'clim' property of the parent axis.

     The face color of each cell of the mesh is determined by interpolating the values of C for each of the cell's vertices; Contrast this with 'imagesc' which renders one cell for each element of C.

     'shading' modifies an attribute determining the manner by which the face color of each cell is interpolated from the values of C, and the visibility of the cells' edges.  By default the attribute is "faceted", which renders a single color for each cell's face with the edge visible.

     If the first argument HAX is an axes handle, then plot into this axis, rather than the current axes returned by 'gca'.

     The optional return value H is a graphics handle to the created surface object.

     If N is a scalar, 'peaks' plots the value of the above function on an N-by-N mesh over the range [-3,3].  The default value for N is 49.

     If N is a vector, then it represents the grid values over which to calculate the function.  If X and Y are specified then the function value is calculated over the specified grid of vertices.

     When called with output arguments, return the data for the function evaluated over the meshgrid.  This can subsequently be plotted with 'surf (X, Y, Z)'.

     Many different combinations of arguments are possible.  The simplest form is

          plot3 (X, Y, Z)

     in which the arguments are taken to be the vertices of the points to be plotted in three dimensions.  If all arguments are vectors of the same length, then a single continuous line is drawn.  If all arguments are matrices, then each column of is treated as a separate line.  No attempt is made to transpose the arguments to make the number of rows match.

     If only two arguments are given, as

          plot3 (X, CPLX)

     the real and imaginary parts of the second argument are used as the Y and Z coordinates, respectively.

     If only one argument is given, as

          plot3 (CPLX)

     the real and imaginary parts of the argument are used as the Y and Z values, and they are plotted versus their index.

     Arguments may also be given in groups of three as

          plot3 (X1, Y1, Z1, X2, Y2, Z2, ...)

     in which each set of three arguments is treated as a separate line or set of lines in three dimensions.

     To plot multiple one- or two-argument groups, separate each group with an empty format string, as

          plot3 (X1, C1, "", C2, "", ...)

     Multiple property-value pairs may be specified which will affect the line objects drawn by 'plot3'.  If the FMT argument is supplied it will format the line objects in the same manner as 'plot'.

     If the first argument HAX is an axes handle, then plot into this axis, rather than the current axes returned by 'gca'.

     The optional return value H is a graphics handle to the created plot.

     Example:

          z = [0:0.05:5];
          plot3 (cos (2*pi*z), sin (2*pi*z), z, ";helix;");

     Produce 2-D plots.

     Many different combinations of arguments are possible.  The simplest form is

          plot (Y)

     where the argument is taken as the set of Y coordinates and the X coordinates are taken to be the range '1:numel (Y)'.

     If more than one argument is given, they are interpreted as

          plot (Y, PROPERTY, VALUE, ...)

     or

          plot (X, Y, PROPERTY, VALUE, ...)

     or

          plot (X, Y, FMT, ...)

     and so on.  Any number of argument sets may appear.  The X and Y values are interpreted as follows:

        * If a single data argument is supplied, it is taken as the set of Y coordinates and the X coordinates are taken to be the indices of the elements, starting with 1.

        * If X and Y are scalars, a single point is plotted.

        * 'squeeze()' is applied to arguments with more than two dimensions, but no more than two singleton dimensions.

        * If both arguments are vectors, the elements of Y are plotted versus the elements of X.

        * If X is a vector and Y is a matrix, then the columns (or rows) of Y are plotted versus X.  (using whichever combination matches, with columns tried first.)

        * If the X is a matrix and Y is a vector, Y is plotted versus the columns (or rows) of X.  (using whichever combination matches, with columns tried first.)

        * If both arguments are matrices, the columns of Y are plotted versus the columns of X.  In this case, both matrices must have the same number of rows and columns and no attempt is made to transpose the arguments to make the number of rows match.

     Multiple property-value pairs may be specified, but they must appear in pairs.  These arguments are applied to the line objects drawn by 'plot'.  Useful properties to modify are "linestyle", "linewidth", "color", "marker", "markersize", "markeredgecolor", "markerfacecolor".  *Note Line Properties::.

     The FMT format argument can also be used to control the plot style.  It is a string composed of four optional parts: "<linestyle><marker><color><;displayname;>".  When a marker is specified, but no linestyle, only the markers are plotted.  Similarly, if a linestyle is specified, but no marker, then only lines are drawn.  If both are specified then lines and markers will be plotted.  If no FMT and no PROPERTY/VALUE pairs are given, then the default plot style is solid lines with no markers and the color determined by the "colororder" property of the current axes.

     Format arguments:

     linestyle

          '-'                                                           Use solid lines (default).

     ";displayname;"
          Here "displayname" is the label to use for the plot legend.

     The FMT argument may also be used to assign legend labels.  To do so, include the desired label between semicolons after the formatting sequence described above, e.g., "+b;Key Title;".  Note that the last semicolon is required and Octave will generate an error if it is left out.

     Here are some plot examples:

          plot (x, y, "or", x, y2, x, y3, "m", x, y4, "+")

     This command will plot 'y' with red circles, 'y2' with solid lines, 'y3' with solid magenta lines, and 'y4' with points displayed as '+'.

          plot (b, "*", "markersize", 10)

     This command will plot the data in the variable 'b', with points displayed as '*' and a marker size of 10.

          t = 0:0.1:6.3;
          plot (t, cos(t), "-;cos(t);", t, sin(t), "-b;sin(t);");

     This will plot the cosine and sine functions and label them accordingly in the legend.

     If the first argument HAX is an axes handle, then plot into this axis, rather than the current axes returned by 'gca'.

     The optional return value H is a vector of graphics handles to the created line objects.

     To save a plot, in one of several image formats such as PostScript or PNG, use the 'print' command.

     Scatter plot of the columns of one matrix against another.

     Given the arguments X and Y that have a matching number of rows, 'plotmatrix' plots a set of axes corresponding to

          plot (X(:, i), Y(:, j))

     When called with a single argument X this is equivalent to

          plotmatrix (X, X)

     except that the diagonal of the set of axes will be replaced with the histogram 'hist (X(:, i))'.

     The marker to use can be changed with the STYLE argument, that is a string defining a marker in the same manner as the 'plot' command.

     If the first argument HAX is an axes handle, then plot into this axis, rather than the current axes returned by 'gca'.

     The optional return value H provides handles to the individual graphics objects in the scatter plots, whereas AX returns the handles to the scatter plot axis objects.

     BIGAX is a hidden axis object that surrounds the other axes, such that the commands 'xlabel', 'title', etc., will be associated with this hidden axis.

     Finally, P returns the graphics objects associated with the histogram and PAX the corresponding axes objects.

     Example:

     Plot two sets of data with independent y-axes and a common x-axis.

     The arguments X1 and Y1 define the arguments for the first plot and X1 and Y2 for the second.

     By default the arguments are evaluated with 'feval (@plot, X, Y)'.  However the type of plot can be modified with the FUN argument, in which case the plots are generated by 'feval (FUN, X, Y)'.  FUN can be a function handle, an inline function, or a string of a function name.

     The function to use for each of the plots can be independently defined with FUN1 and FUN2.

     If the first argument HAX is an axes handle, then it defines the principal axis in which to plot the X1 and Y1 data.

     The return value AX is a vector with the axis handles of the two y-axes.  H1 and H2 are handles to the objects generated by the plot commands.

          x = 0:0.1:2*pi;
          y1 = sin (x);
          y2 = exp (x - 1);

     Create a 2-D plot from polar coordinates THETA and RHO.

     If a single complex input CPLX is given then the real part is used for THETA and the imaginary part is used for RHO.

     The optional argument FMT specifies the line format in the same way as 'plot'.

     If the first argument HAX is an axes handle, then plot into this axis, rather than the current axes returned by 'gca'.

     The optional return value H is a graphics handle to the created plot.

     Implementation Note: The polar axis is drawn using line and text objects encapsulated in an hggroup.  The hggroup properties are linked to the original axes object such that altering an appearance property, for example 'fontname', will update the polar axis.  Two new properties are added to the original axes-'rtick', 'ttick'-which replace 'xtick', 'ytick'.  The first is a list of tick locations in the radial (rho) direction; The second is a list of tick locations in the angular (theta) direction specified in degrees, i.e., in the range 0-359.

     Plot a 3-D vector field with arrows.

     Plot the (U, V, W) components of a vector field in an (X, Y, Z) meshgrid.  If the grid is uniform then X, Y, and Z can be specified as vectors.

     If X, Y, and Z are undefined they are assumed to be '(1:M, 1:N, 1:P)' where '[M, N] = size (U)' and 'P = max (size (W))'.

     The variable S is a scalar defining a scaling factor to use for the arrows of the field relative to the mesh spacing.  A value of 0 disables all scaling.  The default value is 0.9.

     Draw a rectangular patch defined by POS and CURV.

     The variable 'POS(1:2)' defines the lower left-hand corner of the patch and 'POS(3:4)' defines its width and height.  By default, the value of POS is '[0, 0, 1, 1]'.

     The variable CURV defines the curvature of the sides of the rectangle and may be a scalar or two-element vector with values between 0 and 1.  A value of 0 represents no curvature of the side, whereas a value of 1 means that the side is entirely curved into the arc of a circle.  If CURV is a two-element vector, then the first element is the curvature along the x-axis of the patch and the second along y-axis.

     If CURV is a scalar, it represents the curvature of the shorter of the two sides of the rectangle and the curvature of the other side is defined by

          min (pos(1:2)) / max (pos(1:2)) * curv

     Reduce the size of faces in a patch by the shrink factor SF.

     The patch object can be specified by a graphics handle (P), a patch structure (FV) with the fields "faces" and "vertices", or as two separate matrices (F, V) of faces and vertices.

     The shrink factor SF is a positive number specifying the percentage of the original area the new face will occupy.  If no factor is given the default is 0.3 (a reduction to 30% of the original size).  A factor greater than 1.0 will result in the expansion of faces.

     Given a patch handle as the first input argument and no output parameters, perform the shrinking of the patch faces in place and redraw the patch.

     If called with one output argument, return a structure with fields "faces", "vertices", and "facevertexcdata" containing the data after shrinking.  This structure can be used directly as an input argument to the 'patch' function.

     *Caution:*: Performing the shrink operation on faces which are not convex can lead to undesirable results.

     Example: a triangulated 3/4 circle and the corresponding shrunken version.

          [phi r] = meshgrid (linspace (0, 1.5*pi, 16), linspace (1, 2, 4));
          tri = delaunay (phi(:), r(:));

          clf ()

     Plot slices of 3-D data/scalar fields.

     Each element of the 3-dimensional array V represents a scalar value at a location given by the parameters X, Y, and Z.  The parameters X, X, and Z are either 3-dimensional arrays of the same size as the array V in the "meshgrid" format or vectors.  The parameters XI, etc.  respect a similar format to X, etc., and they represent the points at which the array VI is interpolated using interp3.  The vectors SX, SY, and SZ contain points of orthogonal slices of the respective axes.

     If X, Y, Z are omitted, they are assumed to be 'x = 1:size (V, 2)', 'y = 1:size (V, 1)' and 'z = 1:size (V, 3)'.

     METHOD is one of:

     "nearest"
          Return the nearest neighbor.

     "linear"
          Linear interpolation from nearest neighbors.

     "cubic"
          Cubic interpolation from four nearest neighbors (not implemented yet).

     "spline"
          Cubic spline interpolation--smooth first and second derivatives throughout the curve.

     The default method is "linear".

     If the first argument HAX is an axes handle, then plot into this axis, rather than the current axes returned by 'gca'.

     The optional return value H is a graphics handle to the created surface object.

     Plot the familiar 3-D sombrero function.

     The function plotted is

          z = sin (sqrt (x^2 + y^2)) / (sqrt (x^2 + y^2))

     Called without a return argument, 'sombrero' plots the surface of the above function over the meshgrid [-8,8] using 'surf'.

     If N is a scalar the plot is made with N grid lines.  The default value for N is 41.

     When called with output arguments, return the data for the function evaluated over the meshgrid.  This can subsequently be plotted with 'surf (X, Y, Z)'.

 -- Function File: PLOTSTR = stemleaf (...)
     Compute and display a stem and leaf plot of the vector X.

     The input X should be a vector of integers.  Any non-integer values will be converted to integer by 'X = fix (X)'.  By default each element of X will be plotted with the last digit of the element as a leaf value and the remaining digits as the stem.  For example, 123 will be plotted with the stem '12' and the leaf '3'.  The second argument, CAPTION, should be a character array which provides a description of the data.  It is included as a heading for the output.

     The optional input STEM_SZ sets the width of each stem.  The stem width is determined by '10^(STEM_SZ + 1)'.  The default stem width is 10.

     The output of 'stemleaf' is composed of two parts: a "Fenced Letter Display," followed by the stem-and-leaf plot itself.  The Fenced Letter Display is described in 'Exploratory Data Analysis'.  Briefly, the entries are as shown:


                  Fenced Letter Display

                                        fences

     The stem-and-leaf plot shows on each line the stem value followed by the string made up of the leaf digits.  If the STEM_SZ is not 1 the successive leaf values are separated by ",".

     With no return argument, the plot is immediately displayed.  If an output argument is provided, the plot is returned as an array of strings.

     The leaf digits are not sorted.  If sorted leaf values are desired, use 'XS = sort (X)' before calling 'stemleaf (XS)'.

     The stem and leaf plot and associated displays are described in: Ch.  3, 'Exploratory Data Analysis' by J. W. Tukey, Addison-Wesley, 1977.

     Plot a 2-D stem graph.

     If only one argument is given, it is taken as the y-values and the x-coordinates are taken from the indices of the elements.

     If Y is a matrix, then each column of the matrix is plotted as a separate stem graph.  In this case X can either be a vector, the same length as the number of rows in Y, or it can be a matrix of the same size as Y.

     The default color is "b" (blue), the default line style is "-", and the default marker is "o".  The line style can be altered by the 'linespec' argument in the same manner as the 'plot' command.  If the "filled" argument is present the markers at the top of the stems will be filled in.  For example,

          x = 1:10;
          y = 2*x;
          stem (x, y, "r");

     plots 10 stems with heights from 2 to 20 in red;

     Optional property/value pairs may be specified to control the appearance of the plot.

     If the first argument HAX is an axes handle, then plot into this axis, rather than the current axes returned by 'gca'.

     The optional return value H is a handle to a "stem series" hggroup.  The single hggroup handle has all of the graphical elements comprising the plot as its children; This allows the properties of multiple graphics objects to be changed by modifying just a single property of the "stem series" hggroup.

     For example,

          x = [0:10]';
          y = [sin(x), cos(x)]
          h = stem (x, y);
          set (h(2), "color", "g");
          set (h(1), "basevalue", -1)

     changes the color of the second "stem series" and moves the base line of the first.

     Stem Series Properties

     linestyle
          The linestyle of the stem.  (Default: "-")

     linewidth
          The width of the stem.  (Default: 0.5)

     color
          The color of the stem, and if not separately specified, the marker.  (Default: "b" [blue])

     marker
          The marker symbol to use at the top of each stem.  (Default: "o")

     markeredgecolor
          The edge color of the marker.  (Default: "color" property)

     markerfacecolor
          The color to use for "filling" the marker.  (Default: "none" [unfilled])

     markersize
          The size of the marker.  (Default: 6)

     baseline
          The handle of the line object which implements the baseline.  Use 'set' with the returned handle to change graphic properties of the baseline.

     basevalue
          The y-value where the baseline is drawn.  (Default: 0)

     Plot a 3-D surface mesh with underlying contour lines.

     The surface mesh is plotted using shaded rectangles.  The vertices of the rectangles [X, Y] are typically the output of 'meshgrid'.  over a 2-D rectangular region in the x-y plane.  Z determines the height above the plane of each vertex.  If only a single Z matrix is given, then it is plotted over the meshgrid 'X = 1:columns (Z), Y = 1:rows (Z)'.  Thus, columns of Z correspond to different X values and rows of Z correspond to different Y values.

     The color of the surface is computed by linearly scaling the Z values to fit the range of the current colormap.  Use 'caxis' and/or change the colormap to control the appearance.

     Plot a 3-D surface using shading based on various lighting models.

     The surface mesh is plotted using shaded rectangles.  The vertices of the rectangles [X, Y] are typically the output of 'meshgrid'.  over a 2-D rectangular region in the x-y plane.  Z determines the height above the plane of each vertex.  If only a single Z matrix is given, then it is plotted over the meshgrid 'X = 1:columns (Z), Y = 1:rows (Z)'.  Thus, columns of Z correspond to different X values and rows of Z correspond to different Y values.

     The default lighting mode "cdata", changes the cdata property of the surface object to give the impression of a lighted surface.  *Warning:* The alternative mode "light" mode which creates a light object to illuminate the surface is not implemented (yet).

     The light source location can be specified using LSRC.  It can be given as a 2-element vector [azimuth, elevation] in degrees, or as a 3-element vector [lx, ly, lz].  The default value is rotated 45 degrees counterclockwise to the current view.

     The material properties of the surface can specified using a 4-element vector P = [AM D SP EXP] which defaults to P = [0.55 0.6 0.4 10].

     "AM" strength of ambient light

     Find the vectors normal to a meshgridded surface.

     If X and Y are vectors, then a typical vertex is (X(j), Y(i), Z(i,j)).  Thus, columns of Z correspond to different X values and rows of Z correspond to different Y values.  If only a single input Z is given then X is taken to be '1:rows (Z)' and Y is '1:columns (Z)'.

     If no return arguments are requested, a surface plot with the normal vectors to the surface is plotted.

     Any property/value input pairs are assigned to the surface object.

     If the first argument HAX is an axes handle, then plot into this axis, rather than the current axes returned by 'gca'.

     If output arguments are requested then the components of the normal vectors are returned in NX, NY, and NZ and no plot is made.

     An example of the use of 'surfnorm' is

          surfnorm (peaks (25));

     Algorithm: The normal vectors are calculated by taking the cross product of the diagonals of each of the quadrilaterals in the meshgrid to find the normal vectors of the centers of these quadrilaterals.  The four nearest normal vectors to the meshgrid points are then averaged to obtain the normal to the surface at the meshgridded points.

     Display the tetrahedrons defined in the m-by-4 matrix T as 3-D patches.

     T is typically the output of a Delaunay triangulation of a 3-D set of points.  Every row of T contains four indices into the n-by-3 matrix X of the vertices of a tetrahedron.  Every row in X represents one point in 3-D space.

     The vector C specifies the color of each tetrahedron as an index into the current colormap.  The default value is 1:m where m is the number of tetrahedrons; the indices are scaled to map to the full range of the colormap.  If there are more tetrahedrons than colors in the colormap then the values in C are cyclically repeated.

     Calling 'tetramesh (..., "property", "value", ...)' passes all property/value pairs directly to the patch function as additional arguments.

     The optional return value H is a vector of patch handles where each handle represents one tetrahedron in the order given by T.  A typical use case for H is to turn the respective patch "visible" property "on" or "off".

     Type 'demo tetramesh' to see examples on using 'tetramesh'.

     Plot a 3-D triangular wireframe mesh.

     In contrast to 'mesh', which plots a mesh using rectangles, 'trimesh' plots the mesh using triangles.

     TRI is typically the output of a Delaunay triangulation over the grid of X, Y.  Every row of TRI represents one triangle and contains three indices into [X, Y] which are the vertices of the triangles in the x-y plane.  Z determines the height above the plane of each vertex.  If no Z input is given then the triangles are plotted as a 2-D figure.

     The color of the trimesh is computed by linearly scaling the Z values to fit the range of the current colormap.  Use 'caxis' and/or change the colormap to control the appearance.

     Optionally, the color of the mesh can be specified independently of Z by supplying a color matrix, C.  If Z has N elements, then C should be an Nx1 vector for colormap data or an Nx3 matrix for RGB data.

     Any property/value pairs are passed directly to the underlying patch object.

     The optional return value H is a graphics handle to the created patch object.

     TRI is typically the output of a Delaunay triangulation over the grid of X, Y.  Every row of TRI represents one triangle and contains three indices into [X, Y] which are the vertices of the triangles in the x-y plane.

     The linestyle to use for the plot can be defined with the argument LINESPEC of the same format as the 'plot' command.

     The optional return value H is a graphics handle to the created patch object.

     Plot a 3-D triangular surface.

     In contrast to 'surf', which plots a surface mesh using rectangles, 'trisurf' plots the mesh using triangles.

     TRI is typically the output of a Delaunay triangulation over the grid of X, Y.  Every row of TRI represents one triangle and contains three indices into [X, Y] which are the vertices of the triangles in the x-y plane.  Z determines the height above the plane of each vertex.

     The color of the trimesh is computed by linearly scaling the Z values to fit the range of the current colormap.  Use 'caxis' and/or change the colormap to control the appearance.

     Optionally, the color of the mesh can be specified independently of Z by supplying a color matrix, C.  If Z has N elements, then C should be an Nx1 vector for colormap data or an Nx3 matrix for RGB data.

     Any property/value pairs are passed directly to the underlying patch object.

     The optional return value H is a graphics handle to the created patch object.

 -- Function File: H = waterfall (...)
     Plot a 3-D waterfall plot.

     A waterfall plot is similar to a 'meshz' plot except only mesh lines for the rows of Z (x-values) are shown.

     The wireframe mesh is plotted using rectangles.  The vertices of the rectangles [X, Y] are typically the output of 'meshgrid'.  over a 2-D rectangular region in the x-y plane.  Z determines the height above the plane of each vertex.  If only a single Z matrix is given, then it is plotted over the meshgrid 'X = 1:columns (Z), Y = 1:rows (Z)'.  Thus, columns of Z correspond to different X values and rows of Z correspond to different Y values.

     The color of the mesh is computed by linearly scaling the Z values to fit the range of the current colormap.  Use 'caxis' and/or change the colormap to control the appearance.

     Optionally the color of the mesh can be specified independently of Z by supplying a color matrix, C.

     Any property/value pairs are passed directly to the underlying surface object.

     If the first argument HAX is an axes handle, then plot into this axis, rather than the current axes returned by 'gca'.

     The optional return value H is a graphics handle to the created surface object.

     Close figure window(s).

     When called with no arguments, close the current figure.  This is equivalent to 'close (gcf)'.  If the input H is a graphic handle, or vector of graphics handles, then close each figure in H.

     If the argument "all" is given then all figures with visible handles (HandleVisibility = "on") are closed.

     If the argument "all hidden" is given then all figures, including hidden ones, are closed.

     If the argument "all force" is given then all figures are closed even when "closerequestfcn" has been altered to prevent closing the window.

     Implementation Note: 'close' operates by calling the function specified by the "closerequestfcn" property for each figure.  By default, the function 'closereq' is used.  It is possible that the function invoked will delay or abort removing the figure.  To remove a figure without executing any callback functions use 'delete'.  When writing a callback function to close a window do not use 'close' to avoid recursion.

     Find graphics object with specified property values.

     The simplest form is

          findobj (PROP_NAME, PROP_VALUE)

     which returns the handles of all objects which have a property named PROP_NAME that has the value PROP_VALUE.  If multiple property/value pairs are specified then only objects meeting all of the conditions are returned.

     The search can be limited to a particular set of objects and their descendants, by passing a handle or set of handles HLIST as the first argument.

     The depth of the object hierarchy to search can be limited with the "-depth" argument.  An example of searching only three generations of children is:

          findobj (HLIST, "-depth", 3, PROP_NAME, PROP_VALUE)

     Specifying a depth D of 0, limits the search to the set of objects passed in HLIST.  A depth D of 0 is equivalent to the "flat" argument.

     A specified logical operator may be applied to the pairs of PROP_NAME and PROP_VALUE.  The supported logical operators are: "-and", "-or", "-xor", "-not".

     Objects may also be matched by comparing a regular expression to the property values, where property values that match 'regexp (PROP_VALUE, PATTERN)' are returned.

     Finally, objects may be matched by property name only by using the "-property" option.

     Implementation Note: The search only includes objects with visible handles (HandleVisibility = "on").  *Note findall: XREFfindall, to search for all objects including hidden ones.

     Return a handle to the current axis object.

     The current axis is the default target for graphics output.  In the case of a figure with multiple axes, 'gca' returns the last created axes or the last axes that was clicked on with the mouse.

     If no current axes object exists, create one and return its handle.  The handle may then be used to examine or set properties of the axes.  For example,

          ax = gca ();
          set (ax, "position", [0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5]);

     creates an empty axes object and then changes its location and size in the figure window.

     Note: To find the current axis without creating a new axes object if it does not exist, query the "CurrentAxes" property of a figure.

          get (gcf, "currentaxes");

 -- Function File: H = gcf ()
     Return a handle to the current figure.

     The current figure is the default target for graphics output.  If multiple figures exist, 'gcf' returns the last created figure or the last figure that was clicked on with the mouse.

     If a current figure does not exist, create one and return its handle.  The handle may then be used to examine or set properties of the figure.  For example,

          fplot (@sin, [-10, 10]);
          fig = gcf ();
          set (fig, "numbertitle", "off", "name", "sin plot")

     plots a sine wave, finds the handle of the current figure, and then renames the figure window to describe the contents.

     Note: To find the current figure without creating a new one if it does not exist, query the "CurrentFigure" property of the root graphics object.

          get (0, "currentfigure");

 -- Function File: H = gco ()
 -- Function File: H = gco (FIG)
     Return a handle to the current object of the current figure, or a handle to the current object of the figure with handle FIG.

     The current object of a figure is the object that was last clicked on.  It is stored in the "CurrentObject" property of the target figure.

     If the last mouse click did not occur on any child object of the figure, then the current object is the figure itself.

     If no mouse click occurred in the target figure, this function returns an empty matrix.

     Programming Note: The value returned by this function is not necessarily the same as the one returned by 'gcbo' during callback execution.  An executing callback can be interrupted by another callback and the current object may be changed.

 -- Function File: hggroup ()

 -- Function File: H = hggroup (...)
     Create handle graphics group object with axes parent HAX.

     If no parent is specified, the group is created in the current axes.

     Multiple property/value pairs may be specified for the hggroup, but they must appear in pairs.

     The optional return value H is a graphics handle to the created hggroup object.

     Programming Note: An hggroup is a way to group base graphics objects such as line objects or patch objects into a single unit which can react appropriately.  For example, the individual lines of a contour plot are collected into a single hggroup so that they can be made visible/invisible with a single command, 'set (hg_handle, "visible", "off")'.

 -- Function File: hold (HAX, ...)
     Toggle or set the "hold" state of the plotting engine which determines whether new graphic objects are added to the plot or replace the existing objects.

     'hold on'
          Retain plot data and settings so that subsequent plot commands are displayed on a single graph.

     'hold all'
          Retain plot line color, line style, data, and settings so that subsequent plot commands are displayed on a single graph with the next line color and style.

     'hold off'
          Restore default graphics settings which clear the graph and reset axis properties before each new plot command.  (default).

     'hold'
          Toggle the current hold state.

     When given the additional argument HAX, the hold state is modified for this axis rather than the current axes returned by 'gca'.

     To query the current hold state use the 'ishold' function.

     Link the axis limits of 2-D plots such that a change in one is propagated to the others.

     The axes handles to be linked are passed as the first argument HAX.

     The optional second argument is a string which defines which axis limits will be linked.  The possible values for OPTSTR are:

     "x"
          Link x-axes

     "y"
          Link y-axes

     "xy" (default)
          Link both axes

     "off"
          Turn off linking

     If unspecified the default is to link both X and Y axes.

     When linking, the limits from the first axes in HAX are applied to the other axes in the list.  Subsequent changes to any one of the axes will be propagated to the others.

 -- Function File: HLINK = linkprop (H, "PROP")
 -- Function File: HLINK = linkprop (H, {"PROP1", "PROP2", ...})
     Link graphic object properties, such that a change in one is propagated to the others.

     The input H is a vector of graphic handles to link.

     PROP may be a string when linking a single property, or a cell array of strings for multiple properties.  During the linking process all properties in PROP will initially be set to the values that exist on the first object in the list H.

     The function returns HLINK which is a special object describing the link.  As long as the reference HLINK exists the link between graphic objects will be active.  This means that HLINK must be preserved in a workspace variable, a global variable, or otherwise stored using a function such as 'setappdata', 'guidata'.  To unlink properties, execute 'clear HLINK'.

     An example of the use of 'linkprop' is

          x = 0:0.1:10;
          subplot (1,2,1);
          h1 = plot (x, sin (x));
          subplot (1,2,2);
          h2 = plot (x, cos (x));
          hlink = linkprop ([h1, h2], {"color","linestyle"});
          set (h1, "color", "green");
          set (h2, "linestyle", "--");

 -- Function File: [XX, YY, ZZ] = meshgrid (X, Y, Z)
 -- Function File: [XX, YY] = meshgrid (X)
 -- Function File: [XX, YY, ZZ] = meshgrid (X)
     Given vectors of X and Y coordinates, return matrices XX and YY corresponding to a full 2-D grid.

     The rows of XX are copies of X, and the columns of YY are copies of Y.  If Y is omitted, then it is assumed to be the same as X.

     If the optional Z input is given, or ZZ is requested, then the output will be a full 3-D grid.

     'meshgrid' is most frequently used to produce input for a 2-D or 3-D function that will be plotted.  The following example creates a surface plot of the "sombrero" function.

          f = @(x,y) sin (sqrt (x.^2 + y.^2)) ./ sqrt (x.^2 + y.^2);
          range = linspace (-8, 8, 41);
          [X, Y] = meshgrid (range, range);
          Z = f (X, Y);
          surf (X, Y, Z);

     Programming Note: 'meshgrid' is restricted to 2-D or 3-D grid generation.  The 'ndgrid' function will generate 1-D through N-D grids.  However, the functions are not completely equivalent.  If X is a vector of length M and Y is a vector of length N, then 'meshgrid' will produce an output grid which is NxM.  'ndgrid' will produce an output which is MxN (transpose) for the same input.  Some core functions expect 'meshgrid' input and others expect 'ndgrid' input.  Check the documentation for the function in question to determine the proper input format.

     See also: ndgrid, mesh, contour, surf.

 -- Function File: [Y1, Y2, ..., Yn] = ndgrid (X1, X2, ..., Xn)
 -- Function File: [Y1, Y2, ..., Yn] = ndgrid (X)
     Given n vectors X1, ..., Xn, 'ndgrid' returns n arrays of dimension n.

     The elements of the i-th output argument contains the elements of the vector Xi repeated over all dimensions different from the i-th dimension.  Calling ndgrid with only one input argument X is equivalent to calling ndgrid with all n input arguments equal to X:

     [Y1, Y2, ..., Yn] = ndgrid (X, ..., X)

     Programming Note: 'ndgrid' is very similar to the function 'meshgrid' except that the first two dimensions are transposed in comparison to 'meshgrid'.  Some core functions expect 'meshgrid' input and others expect 'ndgrid' input.  Check the documentation for the function in question to determine the proper input format.

     "replacechildren"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Delete child objects whose HandleVisibility is set to "on", but leave axis properties unmodified.  This typically clears a plot, but preserves special settings such as log scaling for axes.  This is equivalent to 'cla'.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
     "replace" (default)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Delete all child objects of the axis and reset all axis properties to their defaults.  However, the following properties are not reset: Position, Units.  This is equivalent to 'cla reset'.

     If the optional input HFIG or HAX is given then prepare the specified figure or axes rather than the current figure and axes.

     The optional return value HAX is a graphics handle to the created axes object (not figure).

     *Caution:* Calling 'newplot' may change the current figure and current axis.

 -- Function File: print ()
 -- Function File: print (OPTIONS)
 -- Function File: print (FILENAME, OPTIONS)
 -- Function File: print (H, FILENAME, OPTIONS)
     Print a plot, or save it to a file.

     Both output formatted for printing (PDF and PostScript), and many bitmapped and vector image formats are supported.

     FILENAME defines the name of the output file.  If the file name has no suffix, one is inferred from the specified device and appended to the file name.  If no filename is specified, the output is sent to the printer.

     H specifies the handle of the figure to print.  If no handle is specified the current figure is used.

     For output to a printer, PostScript file, or PDF file, the paper size is specified by the figure's 'papersize' property.  The location and size of the image on the page are specified by the figure's 'paperposition' property.  The orientation of the page is specified by the figure's 'paperorientation' property.

     The width and height of images are specified by the figure's 'paperpositon(3:4)' property values.

     The 'print' command supports many OPTIONS:

     '-fH'
          Specify the handle, H, of the figure to be printed.  The default is the current figure.

     '-PPRINTER'
          Set the PRINTER name to which the plot is sent if no FILENAME is specified.

     '-GGHOSTSCRIPT_COMMAND'
          Specify the command for calling Ghostscript.  For Unix and Windows the defaults are "gs" and "gswin32c", respectively.

     '-color'
     '-mono'
          Color or monochrome output.

     '-solid'
     '-dashed'
          Force all lines to be solid or dashed, respectively.

     '-portrait'
     '-landscape'
          Specify the orientation of the plot for printed output.  For non-printed output the aspect ratio of the output corresponds to the plot area defined by the "paperposition" property in the orientation specified.  This option is equivalent to changing the figure's "paperorientation" property.

     '-TextAlphaBits=N'
     '-GraphicsAlphaBits=N'
          Octave is able to produce output for various printers, bitmaps, and vector formats by using Ghostscript.  For bitmap and printer output anti-aliasing is applied using Ghostscript's TextAlphaBits and GraphicsAlphaBits options.  The default number of bits for each is 4.  Allowed values for N are 1, 2, or 4.

     '-dDEVICE'
          The available output format is specified by the option DEVICE, and is one of:

          'ps'
          'ps2'
          'psc'
          'psc2'
               PostScript (level 1 and 2, mono and color).  The FLTK graphics toolkit generates PostScript level 3.0.

          'eps'
          'eps2'
          'epsc'
          'epsc2'
               Encapsulated PostScript (level 1 and 2, mono and color).  The FLTK graphic toolkit generates PostScript level 3.0.

          'pslatex'
          'epslatex'
          'pdflatex'
          'pslatexstandalone'
          'epslatexstandalone'
          'pdflatexstandalone'
               Generate a LaTeX file 'FILENAME.tex' for the text portions of a plot and a file 'FILENAME.(ps|eps|pdf)' for the remaining graphics.  The graphics file suffix .ps|eps|pdf is determined by the specified device type.  The LaTeX file produced by the 'standalone' option can be processed directly by LaTeX.  The file generated without the 'standalone' option is intended to be included from another LaTeX document.  In either case, the LaTeX file contains an '\includegraphics' command so that the generated graphics file is automatically included when the LaTeX file is processed.  The text that is written to the LaTeX file contains the strings *exactly* as they were specified in the plot.  If any special characters of the TeX mode interpreter were used, the file must be edited before LaTeX processing.  Specifically, the special characters must be enclosed with dollar signs ('$ ... $'), and other characters that are recognized by LaTeX may also need editing (.e.g., braces).  The 'pdflatex' device, and any
               of the 'standalone' formats, are not available with the Gnuplot toolkit.

          'tikz'
               Generate a LaTeX file using PGF/TikZ.  For the FLTK toolkit the result is PGF.

          'ill'

          'fig'
               XFig.  For the Gnuplot graphics toolkit, the additional options '-textspecial' or '-textnormal' can be used to control whether the special flag should be set for the text in the figure.  (default is '-textnormal')

          'hpgl'
               HP plotter language

          'mf'

          'jpg'
          'jpeg'
               JPEG image

          'gif'
               GIF image (only available for the Gnuplot graphics toolkit)

               PBMplus

          'svg'
               Scalable vector graphics

          'pdf'
               Portable document format

          If the device is omitted, it is inferred from the file extension, or if there is no filename it is sent to the printer as PostScript.

     '-dGHOSTSCRIPT_DEVICE'
          Additional devices are supported by Ghostscript.  Some examples are;

          'pdfwrite'
               Produces pdf output from eps

          'ljet2p'
               HP LaserJet IIP

          'pcx24b'
               24-bit color PCX file format

          'ppm'
               Portable Pixel Map file format

          For a complete list, type 'system ("gs -h")' to see what formats and devices are available.

          When Ghostscript output is sent to a printer the size is determined by the figure's "papersize" property.  When the output is sent to a file the size is determined by the plot box defined by the figure's "paperposition" property.

     '-append'
          Append PostScript or PDF output to a pre-existing file of the same type.

     '-rNUM'
          Resolution of bitmaps in pixels per inch.  For both metafiles and SVG the default is the screen resolution; for other formats it is 150 dpi.  To specify screen resolution, use "-r0".

     '-loose'
     '-tight'
          Force a tight or loose bounding box for eps files.  The default is loose.

     '-PREVIEW'
          Add a preview to eps files.  Supported formats are:

          '-interchange'
               Provide an interchange preview.

          '-metafile'
               Provide a metafile preview.

          '-pict'
               Provide pict preview.

          '-tiff'
               Provide a tiff preview.

     '-SXSIZE,YSIZE'
          Plot size in pixels for EMF, GIF, JPEG, PBM, PNG, and SVG.  For PS, EPS, PDF, and other vector formats the plot size is in points.  This option is equivalent to changing the size of the plot box associated with the "paperposition" property.  When using the command form of the print function you must quote the XSIZE,YSIZE option.  For example, by writing "-S640,480".

     '-FFONTNAME'
     '-FFONTNAME:SIZE'
     '-F:SIZE'
          Use FONTNAME and/or FONTSIZE for all text.  FONTNAME is ignored for some devices: dxf, fig, hpgl, etc.

     The filename and options can be given in any order.

     Example: Print to a file using the pdf device.

          figure (1);
          clf ();
          surf (peaks);
          print figure1.pdf

     Example: Print to a file using jpg device.

          clf ();
          surf (peaks);
          print -djpg figure2.jpg

     Example: Print to printer named PS_printer using ps format.

          clf ();
          surf (peaks);
          print -dpswrite -PPS_printer

     Evaluate any 'datasource' properties of the current figure and update the plot if the corresponding data has changed.

     If the first argument H is a list of graphic handles, then operate on these objects rather than the current figure returned by 'gcf'.

     The optional second argument WORKSPACE can take the following values:

     "base"
          Evaluate the datasource properties in the base workspace.  (default).

     "caller"
          Evaluate the datasource properties in the workspace of the function that called 'refreshdata'.

     An example of the use of 'refreshdata' is:

          x = 0:0.1:10;
          y = sin (x);
          plot (x, y, "ydatasource", "y");

     Construct a graphics handle object H from the structure S.

     The structure must contain the fields "handle", "type", "children", "properties", and "special".

     If the handle of an existing figure or axes is specified, P, the new object will be created as a child of that object.  If no parent handle is provided then a new figure and the necessary children will be constructed using the default values from the root figure.

     A third boolean argument HILEV can be passed to specify whether the function should preserve listeners/callbacks, e.g., for legends or hggroups.  The default is false.

 -- Function File: subplot (..., PROP, VAL, ...)
 -- Function File: HAX = subplot (...)
     Set up a plot grid with ROWS by COLS subwindows and set the current axes for plotting ('gca') to the location given by INDEX.

     If only one numeric argument is supplied, then it must be a three digit value specifying the number of rows in digit 1, the number of columns in digit 2, and the plot index in digit 3.

     The plot index runs row-wise; First, all columns in a row are numbered and then the next row is filled.

     For example, a plot with 2x3 grid will have plot indices running as follows:

          +-----+-----+-----+
          |  1  |  2  |  3  |
          +-----+-----+-----+
          |  4  |  5  |  6  |
          +-----+-----+-----+

     INDEX may also be a vector.  In this case, the new axis will enclose the grid locations specified.  The first demo illustrates this:

          demo ("subplot", 1)

     The index of the subplot to make active may also be specified by its axes handle, HAX, returned from a previous 'subplot' command.

     If the option "align" is given then the plot boxes of the subwindows will align, but this may leave no room for axis tick marks or labels.

     If the option "replace" is given then the subplot axis will be reset, rather than just switching the current axis for plotting to the requested subplot.

     The "position" property can be used to exactly position the subplot axes within the current figure.  The option POS is a 4-element vector [x, y, width, height] that determines the location and size of the axes.  The values in POS are normalized in the range [0,1].

     Any property/value pairs are passed directly to the underlying axes object.

     If the output HAX is requested, subplot returns the axis handle for the subplot.  This is useful for modifying the properties of a subplot using 'set'.

     Zoom the current axes object or control the interactive zoom mode of a figure in the GUI.

     Given a numeric argument greater than zero, zoom by the given factor.  If the zoom factor is greater than one, zoom in on the plot.  If the factor is less than one, zoom out.  If the zoom factor is a two- or three-element vector, then the elements specify the zoom factors for the x, y, and z axes respectively.

     Given the option "on" or "off", set the interactive zoom mode on or off.

     With no arguments, toggle the current zoom mode on or off.

     Given the option "xon" or "yon", enable zoom mode for the x or y-axis only.

     Given the option "out", zoom to the initial zoom setting.

     Given the option "reset", store the current zoom setting so that 'zoom out' will return to this zoom level.

     If the first argument HFIG is a figure, then operate on the given figure rather than the current figure as returned by 'gcf'.

     Construct a piecewise polynomial (pp) structure from sample points BREAKS and coefficients COEFS.

     BREAKS must be a vector of strictly increasing values.  The number of intervals is given by 'NI = length (BREAKS) - 1'.

     When M is the polynomial order COEFS must be of size: NI x M + 1.

     The i-th row of COEFS, 'COEFS (I,:)', contains the coefficients for the polynomial over the I-th interval, ordered from highest (M) to lowest (0).

     COEFS may also be a multi-dimensional array, specifying a vector-valued or array-valued polynomial.  In that case the polynomial order is defined by the length of the last dimension of COEFS.  The size of first dimension(s) are given by the scalar or vector D.  If D is not given it is set to '1'.  In any case COEFS is reshaped to a 2-D matrix of size '[NI*prod(D M)] '

 -- Function File: [MULTP, IDXP] = mpoles (P, TOL, REORDER)
     Identify unique poles in P and their associated multiplicity.

     The output is ordered from largest pole to smallest pole.

     If the relative difference of two poles is less than TOL then they are considered to be multiples.  The default value for TOL is 0.001.

     If the optional parameter REORDER is zero, poles are not sorted.

     The output MULTP is a vector specifying the multiplicity of the poles.  'MULTP(n)' refers to the multiplicity of the Nth pole 'P(IDXP(n))'.

          p = [2 3 1 1 2];
          [m, n] = mpoles (p)
             => m = [1; 1; 2; 1; 2]

     Return the Piecewise Cubic Hermite Interpolating Polynomial (pchip) of points X and Y.

     If called with two arguments, return the piecewise polynomial PP that may be used with 'ppval' to evaluate the polynomial at specific points.

     When called with a third input argument, 'pchip' evaluates the pchip polynomial at the points XI.  The third calling form is equivalent to 'ppval (pchip (X, Y), XI)'.

     The variable X must be a strictly monotonic vector (either increasing or decreasing) of length N.

     Y can be either a vector or array.  If Y is a vector then it must be the same length N as X.  If Y is an array then the size of Y must have the form '[S1, S2, ..., SK, N]' The array is reshaped internally to a matrix where the leading dimension is given by 'S1 * S2 * ... * SK' and each row of this matrix is then treated separately.  Note that this is exactly opposite to 'interp1' but is done for MATLAB compatibility.

     If A is a square N-by-N matrix, 'poly (A)' is the row vector of the coefficients of 'det (z * eye (N) - A)', the characteristic polynomial of A.

     For example, the following code finds the eigenvalues of A which are the roots of 'poly (A)'.

          roots (poly (eye (3)))
              => 1.00001 + 0.00001i
                 1.00001 - 0.00001i
                 0.99999 + 0.00000i

     In fact, all three eigenvalues are exactly 1 which emphasizes that for numerical performance the 'eig' function should be used to compute eigenvalues.

     If X is a vector, 'poly (X)' is a vector of the coefficients of the polynomial whose roots are the elements of X.  That is, if C is a polynomial, then the elements of 'D = roots (poly (C))' are contained in C.  The vectors C and D are not identical, however, due to sorting and numerical errors.

     Return the coefficients of a polynomial P(X) of degree N that minimizes the least-squares-error of the fit to the points '[X, Y]'.

     If N is a logical vector, it is used as a mask to selectively force the corresponding polynomial coefficients to be used or ignored.

     The polynomial coefficients are returned in a row vector.

     The optional output S is a structure containing the following fields:

     'R'
          Triangular factor R from the QR decomposition.

     'X'
          The Vandermonde matrix used to compute the polynomial coefficients.

     'C'
          The unscaled covariance matrix, formally equal to the inverse of X'*X, but computed in a way minimizing roundoff error propagation.

     'df'
          The degrees of freedom.

     'normr'
          The norm of the residuals.

     'yf'
          The values of the polynomial for each value of X.

     The second output may be used by 'polyval' to calculate the statistical error limits of the predicted values.  In particular, the standard deviation of P coefficients is given by

     'sqrt (diag (s.C)/s.df)*s.normr'.

     When the third output, MU, is present the coefficients, P, are associated with a polynomial in

     'XHAT = (X - MU(1)) / MU(2)'
     where MU(1) = mean (X), and MU(2) = std (X).

     Find the greatest common divisor of two polynomials.

     This is equivalent to the polynomial found by multiplying together all the common roots.  Together with deconv, you can reduce a ratio of two polynomials.

     The tolerance TOL defaults to 'sqrt (eps)'.

     *Caution:* This is a numerically unstable algorithm and should not be used on large polynomials.

     The second calling form performs the inverse operation and computes the reconstituted quotient of polynomials, B(s)/A(s), from the partial fraction expansion; represented by the residues, poles, and a direct polynomial specified by R, P and K, and the pole multiplicity E.

     If the multiplicity, E, is not explicitly specified the multiplicity is determined by the function 'mpoles'.

     For example:

          r = [-2; 7; 3];
          p = [2; 2; 1];
          k = [1, 0];
          [b, a] = residue (r, p, k)
             => b = [1, -5, 9, -3, 1]
             => a = [1, -5, 8, -4]

          where mpoles is used to determine e = [1; 2; 1]

     Alternatively the multiplicity may be defined explicitly, for example,

          r = [7; 3; -2];
          p = [2; 1; 2];
          k = [1, 0];
          e = [2; 1; 1];
          [b, a] = residue (r, p, k, e)
             => b = [1, -5, 9, -3, 1]
             => a = [1, -5, 8, -4]

     which represents the following partial fraction expansion

           -2        7        3         s^4 - 5s^3 + 9s^2 - 3s + 1
          ----- + ------- + ----- + s = --------------------------

     Compute the roots of the polynomial C.

     For a vector C with N components, return the roots of the polynomial

          c(1) * x^(N-1) + ... + c(N-1) * x + c(N)

     As an example, the following code finds the roots of the quadratic polynomial

          p(x) = x^2 - 5.

          c = [1, 0, -5];
          roots (c)
          =>  2.2361
          => -2.2361

     Note that the true result is +/- sqrt(5) which is roughly +/- 2.2361.

 -- Function File: PP = spline (X, Y)
 -- Function File: YI = spline (X, Y, XI)
     Return the cubic spline interpolant of points X and Y.

     When called with two arguments, return the piecewise polynomial PP that may be used with 'ppval' to evaluate the polynomial at specific points.

     When called with a third input argument, 'spline' evaluates the spline at the points XI.  The third calling form 'spline (X, Y, XI)' is equivalent to 'ppval (spline (X, Y), XI)'.

     The variable X must be a vector of length N.

     Y can be either a vector or array.  If Y is a vector it must have a length of either N or 'N + 2'.  If the length of Y is N, then the "not-a-knot" end condition is used.  If the length of Y is 'N + 2', then the first and last values of the vector Y are the values of the first derivative of the cubic spline at the endpoints.

     If Y is an array, then the size of Y must have the form '[S1, S2, ..., SK, N]' or '[S1, S2, ..., SK, N + 2]'.  The array is reshaped internally to a matrix where the leading dimension is given by 'S1 * S2 * ... * SK' and each row of this matrix is then treated separately.  Note that this is exactly the opposite of 'interp1' but is done for MATLAB compatibility.

 -- Function File: PP = splinefit (..., "order", ORDER)
 -- Function File: PP = splinefit (..., "constraints", CONSTRAINTS)

     Fit a piecewise cubic spline with breaks (knots) BREAKS to the noisy data, X and Y.

     X is a vector, and Y is a vector or N-D array.  If Y is an N-D array, then X(j) is matched to Y(:,...,:,j).

     P is a positive integer defining the number of intervals along X, and P+1 is the number of breaks.  The number of points in each interval differ by no more than 1.

     The optional property PERIODIC is a logical value which specifies whether a periodic boundary condition is applied to the spline.  The length of the period is 'max (BREAKS) - min (BREAKS)'.  The default value is 'false'.

     The optional property ROBUST is a logical value which specifies if robust fitting is to be applied to reduce the influence of outlying data points.  Three iterations of weighted least squares are performed.  Weights are computed from previous residuals.  The sensitivity of outlier identification is controlled by the property BETA.  The value of BETA is restricted to the range, 0 < BETA < 1.  The default value is BETA = 1/2.  Values close to 0 give all data equal weighting.  Increasing values of BETA reduce the influence of outlying data.  Values close to unity may cause instability or rank deficiency.

     The fitted spline is returned as a piecewise polynomial, PP, and may be evaluated using 'ppval'.

     The splines are constructed of polynomials with degree ORDER.  The default is a cubic, ORDER=3.  A spline with P pieces has P+ORDER degrees of freedom.  With periodic boundary conditions the degrees of freedom are reduced to P.

     The optional property, CONSTAINTS, is a structure specifying linear constraints on the fit.  The structure has three fields, "xc", "yc", and "cc".

     "xc"
          Vector of the x-locations of the constraints.

     "yc"
          Constraining values at the locations XC.  The default is an array of zeros.

     "cc"
          Coefficients (matrix).  The default is an array of ones.  The number of rows is limited to the order of the piecewise polynomials, ORDER.

     Constraints are linear combinations of derivatives of order 0 to ORDER-1 according to

          cc(1,j) * y(xc(j)) + cc(2,j) * y'(xc(j)) + ... = yc(:,...,:,j).

     For a linear regression model

          y = x * b + e

     perform a Lagrange Multiplier (LM) test of the null hypothesis of no conditional heteroscedascity against the alternative of CH(P).

     I.e., the model is

          y(t) = b(1) * x(t,1) + ... + b(k) * x(t,k) + e(t),

     given Y up to t-1 and X up to t, e(t) is N(0, h(t)) with

          h(t) = v + a(1) * e(t-1)^2 + ... + a(p) * e(t-p)^2,

     and the null is a(1) == ... == a(p) == 0.

     If the second argument is a scalar integer, k, perform the same test in a linear autoregression model of order k, i.e., with

          [1, y(t-1), ..., y(t-K)]

     as the t-th row of X.

     Under the null, LM approximately has a chisquare distribution with P degrees of freedom and PVAL is the p-value (1 minus the CDF of this distribution at LM) of the test.

     If no output argument is given, the p-value is displayed.

     Return the complex frequency response H of the rational IIR filter whose numerator and denominator coefficients are B and A, respectively.

     The response is evaluated at N angular frequencies between 0 and 2*pi.

     The output value W is a vector of the frequencies.

     If A is omitted, the denominator is assumed to be 1 (this corresponds to a simple FIR filter).

     If N is omitted, a value of 512 is assumed.  For fastest computation, N should factor into a small number of small primes.

     If the fourth argument, "whole", is omitted the response is evaluated at frequencies between 0 and pi.

     'freqz (B, A, W)'

     Evaluate the response at the specific frequencies in the vector W.  The values for W are measured in radians.

     '[...] = freqz (..., FS)'

     Return frequencies in Hz instead of radians assuming a sampling rate FS.  If you are evaluating the response at specific frequencies W, those frequencies should be requested in Hz rather than radians.

     X

          data vector.  If X is real-valued a one-sided spectrum is estimated.  If X is complex-valued, or "RANGE" specifies "twosided", the full spectrum is estimated.

     WIN
          window weight data.  If window is empty or unspecified a default rectangular window is used.  Otherwise, the window is applied to the signal ('X .* WIN') before computing the periodogram.  The window data must be a vector of the same length as X.

     NFFT
          number of frequency bins.  The default is 256 or the next higher power of 2 greater than the length of X ('max (256, 2.^nextpow2 (length (x)))').  If NFFT is greater than the length of the input then X will be zero-padded to the length of NFFT.

     FS
          sampling rate.  The default is 1.

     RANGE
          range of spectrum.  "onesided" computes spectrum from [0..nfft/2+1].  "twosided" computes spectrum from [0..nfft-1].

     The optional second output W are the normalized angular frequencies.  For a one-sided calculation W is in the range [0, pi] if NFFT is even and [0, pi) if NFFT is odd.  Similarly, for a two-sided calculation W is in the range [0, 2*pi] or [0, 2*pi) depending on NFFT.

     If a sampling frequency is specified, FS, then the output frequencies F will be in the range [0, FS/2] or [0, FS/2) for one-sided calculations.  For two-sided calculations the range will be [0, FS).

     Compute the short-time Fourier transform of the vector X with NUM_COEF coefficients by applying a window of WIN_SIZE data points and an increment of INC points.

     Before computing the Fourier transform, one of the following windows is applied:

     "hanning"
          win_type = 1

     "hamming"
          win_type = 2

     "rectangle"
          win_type = 3

     The window names can be passed as strings or by the WIN_TYPE number.

     The following defaults are used for unspecified arguments: WIN_SIZE = 80, INC = 24, NUM_COEF = 64, and WIN_TYPE = 1.

     'Y = stft (X, ...)' returns the absolute values of the Fourier coefficients according to the NUM_COEF positive frequencies.

     '[Y, C] = stft (x, ...)' returns the entire STFT-matrix Y and a 3-element vector C containing the window size, increment, and window type, which is needed by the 'synthesis' function.

     Calculate a limited number of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A, based on a selection criteria.

     The number of eigenvalues and eigenvectors to calculate is given by K and defaults to 6.

     By default, 'eigs' solve the equation 'A * v = lambda * v', where 'lambda' is a scalar representing one of the eigenvalues, and 'v' is the corresponding eigenvector.  If given the positive definite matrix B then 'eigs' solves the general eigenvalue equation 'A * v = lambda * B * v'.

     The argument SIGMA determines which eigenvalues are returned.  SIGMA can be either a scalar or a string.  When SIGMA is a scalar, the K eigenvalues closest to SIGMA are returned.  If SIGMA is a string, it must have one of the following values.

     "lm"
          Largest Magnitude (default).

     "sm"
          Smallest Magnitude.

     "la"
          Largest Algebraic (valid only for real symmetric problems).

     "sa"
          Smallest Algebraic (valid only for real symmetric problems).

     "be"
          Both Ends, with one more from the high-end if K is odd (valid only for real symmetric problems).

     "lr"
          Largest Real part (valid only for complex or unsymmetric problems).

     "sr"
          Smallest Real part (valid only for complex or unsymmetric problems).

     "li"
          Largest Imaginary part (valid only for complex or unsymmetric problems).

     "si"
          Smallest Imaginary part (valid only for complex or unsymmetric problems).

     If OPTS is given, it is a structure defining possible options that 'eigs' should use.  The fields of the OPTS structure are:

     'issym'
          If AF is given, then flags whether the function AF defines a symmetric problem.  It is ignored if A is given.  The default is false.

     'isreal'
          If AF is given, then flags whether the function AF defines a real problem.  It is ignored if A is given.  The default is true.

     'tol'
          Defines the required convergence tolerance, calculated as 'tol * norm (A)'.  The default is 'eps'.

     'maxit'
          The maximum number of iterations.  The default is 300.

     'p'
          The number of Lanzcos basis vectors to use.  More vectors will result in faster convergence, but a greater use of memory.  The optimal value of 'p' is problem dependent and should be in the range K to N.  The default value is '2 * K'.

     'v0'
          The starting vector for the algorithm.  An initial vector close to the final vector will speed up convergence.  The default is for ARPACK to randomly generate a starting vector.  If specified, 'v0' must be an N-by-1 vector where 'N = rows (A)'

     'disp'
          The level of diagnostic printout (0|1|2).  If 'disp' is 0 then diagnostics are disabled.  The default value is 0.

     'cholB'
          Flag if 'chol (B)' is passed rather than B.  The default is false.

     'permB'
          The permutation vector of the Cholesky factorization of B if 'cholB' is true.  That is 'chol (B(permB, permB))'.  The default is '1:N'.

     It is also possible to represent A by a function denoted AF.  AF must be followed by a scalar argument N defining the length of the vector argument accepted by AF.  AF can be a function handle, an inline function, or a string.  When AF is a string it holds the name of the function to use.

     AF is a function of the form 'y = af (x)' where the required return value of AF is determined by the value of SIGMA.  The four possible forms are

     'A * x'
          if SIGMA is not given or is a string other than "sm".

     'A \ x'
          if SIGMA is 0 or "sm".

     '(A - sigma * I) \ x'
          for the standard eigenvalue problem, where 'I' is the identity matrix of the same size as A.

     '(A - sigma * B) \ x'
          for the general eigenvalue problem.

     The return arguments of 'eigs' depend on the number of return arguments requested.  With a single return argument, a vector D of length K is returned containing the K eigenvalues that have been found.  With two return arguments, V is a N-by-K matrix whose columns are the K eigenvectors corresponding to the returned eigenvalues.  The eigenvalues themselves are returned in D in the form of a N-by-K matrix, where the elements on the diagonal are the eigenvalues.

     Given a third return argument FLAG, 'eigs' returns the status of the convergence.  If FLAG is 0 then all eigenvalues have converged.  Any other value indicates a failure to converge.

     This function is based on the ARPACK package, written by R. Lehoucq, K. Maschhoff, D. Sorensen, and C. Yang.  For more information see <http://www.caam.rice.edu/software/ARPACK/>.

 -- Function File: L = ichol (A)
 -- Function File: L = ichol (A, OPTS)

     Compute the incomplete Cholesky factorization of the sparse square matrix A.

     By default, 'ichol' uses only the lower triangle of A and produces a lower triangular factor L such that L*L' approximates A.

     The factor given by this routine may be useful as a preconditioner for a system of linear equations being solved by iterative methods such as PCG (Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient).

     The factorization may be modified by passing options in a structure OPTS.  The option name is a field of the structure and the setting is the value of field.  Names and specifiers are case sensitive.

     type
          Type of factorization.

          "nofill" (default)
               Incomplete Cholesky factorization with no fill-in (IC(0)).

          "ict"
               Incomplete Cholesky factorization with threshold dropping (ICT).

     diagcomp
          A non-negative scalar ALPHA for incomplete Cholesky factorization of 'A + ALPHA * diag (diag (A))' instead of A.  This can be useful when A is not positive definite.  The default value is 0.

     droptol
          A non-negative scalar specifying the drop tolerance for factorization if performing ICT.  The default value is 0 which produces the complete Cholesky factorization.

          Non-diagonal entries of L are set to 0 unless

          'abs (L(i,j)) >= droptol * norm (A(j:end, j), 1)'.

     michol
          Modified incomplete Cholesky factorization:

          "off" (default)
               Row and column sums are not necessarily preserved.

          "on"
               The diagonal of L is modified so that row (and column) sums are preserved even when elements have been dropped during the factorization.  The relationship preserved is: 'A * e = L * L' * e', where e is a vector of ones.

     shape

          "lower" (default)
               Use only the lower triangle of A and return a lower triangular factor L such that L*L' approximates A.

          "upper"
               Use only the upper triangle of A and return an upper triangular factor U such that 'U'*U' approximates A.

     EXAMPLES

     The following problem demonstrates how to factorize a sample symmetric positive definite matrix with the full Cholesky decomposition and with the incomplete one.

          A = [ 0.37, -0.05,  -0.05,  -0.07;
               -0.05,  0.116,  0.0,   -0.05;
               -0.05,  0.0,    0.116, -0.05;
               -0.07, -0.05,  -0.05,   0.202];
          A = sparse (A);
          nnz (tril (A))
          ans =  9
          L = chol (A, "lower");
          nnz (L)
          ans =  10
          norm (A - L * L', "fro") / norm (A, "fro")
          ans =  1.1993e-16
          opts.type = "nofill";
          L = ichol (A, opts);

          norm (A - L * L', "fro") / norm (A, "fro")
          ans =  0.019736

     Compute the incomplete LU factorization of the sparse square matrix A.

     'ilu' returns a unit lower triangular matrix L, an upper triangular matrix U, and optionally a permutation matrix P, such that 'L*U' approximates 'P*A'.

     The factors given by this routine may be useful as preconditioners for a system of linear equations being solved by iterative methods such as BICG (BiConjugate Gradients) or GMRES (Generalized Minimum Residual Method).

     The factorization may be modified by passing options in a structure OPTS.  The option name is a field of the structure and the setting is the value of field.  Names and specifiers are case sensitive.

     'type'
          Type of factorization.

          "nofill"
               ILU factorization with no fill-in (ILU(0)).

               Additional supported options: 'milu'.

          "crout"
               Crout version of ILU factorization (ILUC).

               Additional supported options: 'milu', 'droptol'.

          "ilutp" (default)
               ILU factorization with threshold and pivoting.

               Additional supported options: 'milu', 'droptol', 'udiag', 'thresh'.

     'droptol'
          A non-negative scalar specifying the drop tolerance for factorization.  The default value is 0 which produces the complete LU factorization.

          Non-diagonal entries of U are set to 0 unless

          'abs (U(i,j)) >= droptol * norm (A(:,j))'.

          Non-diagonal entries of L are set to 0 unless

          'abs (L(i,j)) >= droptol * norm (A(:,j))/U(j,j)'.

     'milu'
          Modified incomplete LU factorization:

          "row"
               Row-sum modified incomplete LU factorization.  The factorization preserves row sums: 'A * e = L * U * e', where e is a vector of ones.

          "col"
               Column-sum modified incomplete LU factorization.  The factorization preserves column sums: 'e' * A = e' * L * U'.

          "off" (default)
               Row and column sums are not necessarily preserved.

     'udiag'
          If true, any zeros on the diagonal of the upper triangular factor are replaced by the local drop tolerance 'droptol * norm (A(:,j))/U(j,j)'.  The default is false.

     'thresh'
          Pivot threshold for factorization.  It can range between 0 (diagonal pivoting) and 1 (default), where the maximum magnitude entry in the column is chosen to be the pivot.

     If 'ilu' is called with just one output, the returned matrix is 'L + U - speye (size (A))', where L is unit lower triangular and U is upper triangular.

     With two outputs, 'ilu' returns a unit lower triangular matrix L and an upper triangular matrix U.  For OPTS.type == "ilutp", one of the factors is permuted based on the value of OPTS.milu.  When OPTS.milu == "row", U is a column permuted upper triangular factor.  Otherwise, L is a row-permuted unit lower triangular factor.

     If there are three named outputs and OPTS.milu != "row", P is returned such that L and U are incomplete factors of 'P*A'.  When OPTS.milu == "row", P is returned such that L and U are incomplete factors of 'A*P'.

     EXAMPLES

          A = gallery ("neumann", 1600) + speye (1600);
          opts.type = "nofill";
          nnz (A)
          ans = 7840

          nnz (lu (A))
          ans = 126478

          nnz (ilu (A, opts))
          ans = 7840

     This shows that A has 7,840 nonzeros, the complete LU factorization has 126,478 nonzeros, and the incomplete LU factorization, with 0 level of fill-in, has 7,840 nonzeros, the same amount as A.  Taken from: http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/ilu.html

          A = gallery ("wathen", 10, 10);
          b = sum (A, 2);
          tol = 1e-8;
          maxit = 50;
          opts.type = "crout";
          opts.droptol = 1e-4;
          [L, U] = ilu (A, opts);
          x = bicg (A, b, tol, maxit, L, U);
          norm (A * x - b, inf)

     This example uses ILU as preconditioner for a random FEM-Matrix, which has a large condition number.  Without L and U BICG would not converge.

 -- Function File: [X, FLAG, RELRES, ITER, RESVEC, EIGEST] = pcg (...)

     Solve the linear system of equations 'A * X = B' by means of the Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient iterative method.

     The input arguments are

        * A can be either a square (preferably sparse) matrix or a function handle, inline function or string containing the name of a function which computes 'A * X'.  In principle, A should be symmetric and positive definite; if 'pcg' finds A not to be positive definite, a warning is printed and the FLAG output will be set.

        * B is the right-hand side vector.

        * TOL is the required relative tolerance for the residual error, 'B - A * X'.  The iteration stops if 'norm (B - A * X)' <= TOL * norm (B).  If TOL is omitted or empty then a tolerance of 1e-6 is used.

        * MAXIT is the maximum allowable number of iterations; if MAXIT is omitted or empty then a value of 20 is used.

        * M = M1 * M2 is the (left) preconditioning matrix, so that the iteration is (theoretically) equivalent to solving by 'pcg' 'P * X = M \ B', with 'P = M \ A'.  Note that a proper choice of the preconditioner may dramatically improve the overall performance of the method.  Instead of matrices M1 and M2, the user may pass two functions which return the results of applying the inverse of M1 and M2 to a vector (usually this is the preferred way of using the preconditioner).  If M1 is omitted or empty '[]' then no preconditioning is applied.  If M2 is omitted, M = M1 will be used as a preconditioner.

        * X0 is the initial guess.  If X0 is omitted or empty then the function sets X0 to a zero vector by default.

     The arguments which follow X0 are treated as parameters, and passed in a proper way to any of the functions (A or M) which are passed to 'pcg'.  See the examples below for further details.  The output arguments are

        * X is the computed approximation to the solution of 'A * X = B'.

        * FLAG reports on the convergence.  A value of 0 means the solution converged and the tolerance criterion given by TOL is satisfied.  A value of 1 means that the MAXIT limit for the iteration count was reached.  A value of 3 indicates that the (preconditioned) matrix was found not to be positive definite.

        * RELRES is the ratio of the final residual to its initial value, measured in the Euclidean norm.

        * ITER is the actual number of iterations performed.

        * RESVEC describes the convergence history of the method.  'RESVEC(i,1)' is the Euclidean norm of the residual, and 'RESVEC(i,2)' is the preconditioned residual norm, after the (I-1)-th iteration, 'I = 1, 2, ..., ITER+1'.  The preconditioned residual norm is defined as 'norm (R) ^ 2 = R' * (M \ R)' where 'R = B - A * X', see also the description of M.  If EIGEST is not required, only 'RESVEC(:,1)' is returned.

        * EIGEST returns the estimate for the smallest 'EIGEST(1)' and largest 'EIGEST(2)' eigenvalues of the preconditioned matrix 'P = M \ A'.  In particular, if no preconditioning is used, the estimates for the extreme eigenvalues of A are returned.  'EIGEST(1)' is an overestimate and 'EIGEST(2)' is an underestimate, so that 'EIGEST(2) / EIGEST(1)' is a lower bound for 'cond (P, 2)', which nevertheless in the limit should theoretically be equal to the actual value of the condition number.  The method which computes EIGEST works only for symmetric positive definite A and M, and the user is responsible for verifying this assumption.

     Let us consider a trivial problem with a diagonal matrix (we exploit the sparsity of A)

          n = 10;
          A = diag (sparse (1:n));
          b = rand (n, 1);
          [l, u, p] = ilu (A, struct ("droptol", 1.e-3));

     EXAMPLE 1: Simplest use of 'pcg'

          x = pcg (A, b)

     EXAMPLE 2: 'pcg' with a function which computes 'A * X'

          function y = apply_a (x)
            y = [1:N]' .* x;
          endfunction

          x = pcg ("apply_a", b)

     EXAMPLE 3: 'pcg' with a preconditioner: L * U

          x = pcg (A, b, 1.e-6, 500, l*u)

     EXAMPLE 4: 'pcg' with a preconditioner: L * U.  Faster than EXAMPLE 3 since lower and upper triangular matrices are easier to invert

          x = pcg (A, b, 1.e-6, 500, l, u)

     EXAMPLE 5: Preconditioned iteration, with full diagnostics.  The preconditioner (quite strange, because even the original matrix A is trivial) is defined as a function

          function y = apply_m (x)
            k = floor (length (x) - 2);
            y = x;
            y(1:k) = x(1:k) ./ [1:k]';
          endfunction

          [x, flag, relres, iter, resvec, eigest] = ...
                             pcg (A, b, [], [], "apply_m");
          semilogy (1:iter+1, resvec);

     EXAMPLE 6: Finally, a preconditioner which depends on a parameter K.

          function y = apply_M (x, varargin)
            K = varargin{1};
            y = x;
            y(1:K) = x(1:K) ./ [1:K]';
          endfunction

     Solve the linear system of equations 'A * X = B' by means of the Preconditioned Conjugate Residuals iterative method.

     The input arguments are

        * A can be either a square (preferably sparse) matrix or a function handle, inline function or string containing the name of a function which computes 'A * X'.  In principle A should be symmetric and non-singular; if 'pcr' finds A to be numerically singular, you will get a warning message and the FLAG output parameter will be set.

        * B is the right hand side vector.

        * TOL is the required relative tolerance for the residual error, 'B - A * X'.  The iteration stops if 'norm (B - A * X) <= TOL * norm (B - A * X0)'.  If TOL is empty or is omitted, the function sets 'TOL = 1e-6' by default.

        * MAXIT is the maximum allowable number of iterations; if '[]' is supplied for 'maxit', or 'pcr' has less arguments, a default value equal to 20 is used.

        * M is the (left) preconditioning matrix, so that the iteration is (theoretically) equivalent to solving by 'pcr' 'P * X = M \ B', with 'P = M \ A'.  Note that a proper choice of the preconditioner may dramatically improve the overall performance of the method.  Instead of matrix M, the user may pass a function which returns the results of applying the inverse of M to a vector (usually this is the preferred way of using the preconditioner).  If '[]' is supplied for M, or M is omitted, no preconditioning is applied.

        * X0 is the initial guess.  If X0 is empty or omitted, the function sets X0 to a zero vector by default.

     The arguments which follow X0 are treated as parameters, and passed in a proper way to any of the functions (A or M) which are passed to 'pcr'.  See the examples below for further details.

     The output arguments are

        * X is the computed approximation to the solution of 'A * X = B'.

        * FLAG reports on the convergence.  'FLAG = 0' means the solution converged and the tolerance criterion given by TOL is satisfied.  'FLAG = 1' means that the MAXIT limit for the iteration count was reached.  'FLAG = 3' reports a 'pcr' breakdown, see [1] for details.

        * RELRES is the ratio of the final residual to its initial value, measured in the Euclidean norm.

        * ITER is the actual number of iterations performed.

        * RESVEC describes the convergence history of the method, so that 'RESVEC (i)' contains the Euclidean norms of the residual after the (I-1)-th iteration, 'I = 1,2, ..., ITER+1'.

     Create the augmented matrix of A.

     This is given by

          [C * eye(M, M), A;
                      A', zeros(N, N)]

     This is related to the least squares solution of 'A \ B', by

          S * [ R / C; x] = [ B, zeros(N, columns(B)) ]

     where R is the residual error

          R = B - A * X

     As the matrix S is symmetric indefinite it can be factorized with 'lu', and the minimum norm solution can therefore be found without the need for a 'qr' factorization.  As the residual error will be 'zeros (M, M)' for underdetermined problems, and example can be

          m = 11; n = 10; mn = max (m, n);
          A = spdiags ([ones(mn,1), 10*ones(mn,1), -ones(mn,1)],
                       [-1, 0, 1], m, n);
          x0 = A \ ones (m,1);
          s = spaugment (A);

          x1 = x1(end - n + 1 : end);

     To find the solution of an overdetermined problem needs an estimate of the residual error R and so it is more complex to formulate a minimum norm solution using the 'spaugment' function.

     In general the left division operator is more stable and faster than using the 'spaugment' function.

     A generalization of the function 'diag'.

     Called with a single input argument, the nonzero diagonals D of A are extracted.

     With two arguments the diagonals to extract are given by the vector D.

     The other two forms of 'spdiags' modify the input matrix by replacing the diagonals.  They use the columns of V to replace the diagonals represented by the vector D.  If the sparse matrix A is defined then the diagonals of this matrix are replaced.  Otherwise a matrix of M by N is created with the diagonals given by the columns of V.

     Negative values of D represent diagonals below the main diagonal, and positive values of D diagonals above the main diagonal.

     For example:

          spdiags (reshape (1:12, 4, 3), [-1 0 1], 5, 4)
             => 5 10  0  0

     Return a sparse identity matrix of size MxN.

     The implementation is significantly more efficient than 'sparse (eye (M))' as the full matrix is not constructed.

     Called with a single argument a square matrix of size M-by-M is created.  If called with a single vector argument SZ, this argument is taken to be the size of the matrix to create.

 -- Function File: [U, S, V] = svds (...)
 -- Function File: [U, S, V, FLAG] = svds (...)

     Find a few singular values of the matrix A.

     The singular values are calculated using

          [M, N] = size (A);
          S = eigs ([sparse(M, M), A;
                               A', sparse(N, N)])

     The eigenvalues returned by 'eigs' correspond to the singular values of A.  The number of singular values to calculate is given by K and defaults to 6.

     The argument SIGMA specifies which singular values to find.  When SIGMA is the string 'L', the default, the largest singular values of A are found.  Otherwise, SIGMA must be a real scalar and the singular values closest to SIGMA are found.  As a corollary, 'SIGMA = 0' finds the smallest singular values.  Note that for relatively small values of SIGMA, there is a chance that the requested number of singular values will not be found.  In that case SIGMA should be increased.

     OPTS is a structure defining options that 'svds' will pass to 'eigs'.  The possible fields of this structure are documented in 'eigs'.  By default, 'svds' sets the following three fields:

     'tol'
          The required convergence tolerance for the singular values.  The default value is 1e-10.  'eigs' is passed 'TOL / sqrt(2)'.

     'maxit'
          The maximum number of iterations.  The default is 300.

     'disp'
          The level of diagnostic printout (0|1|2).  If 'disp' is 0 then diagnostics are disabled.  The default value is 0.

     If more than one output is requested then 'svds' will return an approximation of the singular value decomposition of A

          A_approx = U*S*V'

     where A_approx is a matrix of size A but only rank K.

     FLAG returns 0 if the algorithm has succesfully converged, and 1 otherwise.  The test for convergence is

          norm (A*V - U*S, 1) <= TOL * norm (A, 1)

     'svds' is best for finding only a few singular values from a large sparse matrix.  Otherwise, 'svd (full (A))' will likely be more efficient.

If ALPHA is a row vector and X is a column vector, the result is a matrix with 'length (X)' rows and 'length (ALPHA)' columns.  Otherwise, ALPHA and X must conform and the result will be the same size.

     The value of ALPHA must be real.  The value of X may be complex.

     If requested, IERR contains the following status information and is the same size as the result.

       0. Normal return.

       2. Overflow, return 'Inf'.

       3. Loss of significance by argument reduction results in less than half of machine accuracy.

       4. Complete loss of significance by argument reduction, return 'NaN'.

       5. Error--no computation, algorithm termination condition not met, return 'NaN'.

 -- Function File: isprime (X)
     Return a logical array which is true where the elements of X are prime numbers and false where they are not.

     A prime number is conventionally defined as a positive integer greater than 1 (e.g., 2, 3, ...) which is divisible only by itself and 1.  Octave extends this definition to include both negative integers and complex values.  A negative integer is prime if its positive counterpart is prime.  This is equivalent to 'isprime (abs (x))'.

     If 'class (X)' is complex, then primality is tested in the domain of Gaussian integers (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_integer>).  Some non-complex integers are prime in the ordinary sense, but not in the domain of Gaussian integers.  For example, 5 = (1+2i)*(1-2i) shows that 5 is not prime because it has a factor other than itself and 1.  Exercise caution when testing complex and real values together in the same matrix.

     Examples:

          isprime (1:6)
              => [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0]

          isprime ([i, 2, 3, 5])
              => [0, 0, 1, 0]

     Programming Note: 'isprime' is appropriate if the maximum value in X is not too large (< 1e15).  For larger values special purpose factorization code should be used.

     Compatibility Note: MATLAB does not extend the definition of prime numbers and will produce an error if given negative or complex inputs.

     When the optional argument 'normalization' is "sch", compute the Schmidt semi-normalized associated Legendre function.  The Schmidt semi-normalized associated Legendre function is related to the unnormalized Legendre functions by the following:

     For Legendre functions of degree N and order 0:

            0      0
          SP(x) = P(x)
            n      n

     For Legendre functions of degree n and order m:

            m      m         m    2(n-m)! 0.5
          SP(x) = P(x) * (-1)  * [-------]
            n      n              (n+m)!

     When the optional argument NORMALIZATION is "norm", compute the fully normalized associated Legendre function.  The fully normalized associated Legendre function is related to the unnormalized Legendre functions by the following:

     For Legendre functions of degree N and order M

            m      m         m    (n+0.5)(n-m)! 0.5

 -- Function File: C = nchoosek (N, K)
 -- Function File: C = nchoosek (SET, K)

     Compute the binomial coefficient of N or list all possible combinations of a SET of items.

     If N is a scalar then calculate the binomial coefficient of N and K which is defined as

           /   \
           | n |    n (n-1) (n-2) ... (n-k+1)       n!
           |   |  = ------------------------- =  ---------
           | k |               k!                k! (n-k)!
           \   /

     This is the number of combinations of N items taken in groups of size K.

     If the first argument is a vector, SET, then generate all combinations of the elements of SET, taken K at a time, with one row per combination.  The result C has K columns and 'nchoosek (length (SET), K)' rows.

     For example:

     How many ways can three items be grouped into pairs?

          nchoosek (3, 2)
             => 3

     What are the possible pairs?

          nchoosek (1:3, 2)
             =>  1   2
                 1   3
                 2   3

     Programming Note: When calculating the binomial coefficient 'nchoosek' works only for non-negative, integer arguments.  Use 'bincoeff' for non-integer and negative scalar arguments, or for computing many binomial coefficients at once with vector inputs for N or K.

     Construct a Hadamard matrix (Hn) of size N-by-N.

     The size N must be of the form 2^k * p in which p is one of 1, 12, 20 or 28.  The returned matrix is normalized, meaning 'Hn(:,1) == 1' and 'Hn(1,:) == 1'.

     Some of the properties of Hadamard matrices are:

        * 'kron (Hm, Hn)' is a Hadamard matrix of size M-by-N.

        * 'Hn * Hn' = N * eye (N)'.

        * The rows of Hn are orthogonal.

        * 'det (A) <= abs (det (Hn))' for all A with 'abs (A(i, j)) <= 1'.

        * Multiplying any row or column by -1 and the matrix will remain a Hadamard matrix.

                      \ k-1 /   \k/

     The validity of this formula can easily be checked by expanding the binomial coefficients in both formulas as factorials.  It can be derived more directly via the theory of Cauchy matrices.  See J. W. Demmel, 'Applied Numerical Linear Algebra', p.  92.

     Compare this with the numerical calculation of 'inverse (hilb (n))', which suffers from the ill-conditioning of the Hilbert matrix, and the finite precision of your computer's floating point arithmetic.

     Compute the covariance matrix.

     If each row of X and Y is an observation, and each column is a variable, then the (I, J)-th entry of 'cov (X, Y)' is the covariance between the I-th variable in X and the J-th variable in Y.

          cov (x) = 1/N-1 * SUM_i (x(i) - mean(x)) * (y(i) - mean(y))

     If called with one argument, compute 'cov (X, X)', the covariance between the columns of X.

     The argument OPT determines the type of normalization to use.  Valid values are

     0:
          normalize with N-1, provides the best unbiased estimator of the covariance [default]

     1:
          normalize with N, this provides the second moment around the mean

     Compatibility Note:: Octave always computes the covariance matrix.  For two inputs, however, MATLAB will calculate 'cov (X(:), Y(:))' whenever the number of elements in X and Y are equal.  This will result in a scalar rather than a matrix output.  Code relying on this odd definition will need to be changed when running in Octave.

     Compute histogram counts.

     When X is a vector, the function counts the number of elements of X that fall in the histogram bins defined by EDGES.  This must be a vector of monotonically increasing values that define the edges of the histogram bins.  'N(k)' contains the number of elements in X for which 'EDGES(k) <= X < EDGES(k+1)'.  The final element of N contains the number of elements of X exactly equal to the last element of EDGES.

     When X is an N-dimensional array, the computation is carried out along dimension DIM.  If not specified DIM defaults to the first non-singleton dimension.

     When a second output argument is requested an index matrix is also returned.  The IDX matrix has the same size as X.  Each element of IDX contains the index of the histogram bin in which the corresponding element of X was counted.

     Compute Kendall's TAU.

     For two data vectors X, Y of common length N, Kendall's TAU is the correlation of the signs of all rank differences of X and Y; i.e., if both X and Y have distinct entries, then

                   1
          tau = -------   SUM sign (q(i) - q(j)) * sign (r(i) - r(j))
                n (n-1)   i,j

     in which the Q(I) and R(I) are the ranks of X and Y, respectively.

     If X and Y are drawn from independent distributions, Kendall's TAU is asymptotically normal with mean 0 and variance '(2 * (2N+5)) / (9 * N * (N-1))'.

     'kendall (X)' is equivalent to 'kendall (X, X)'.

     Compute the sample kurtosis of the elements of X.

     The sample kurtosis is defined as

               mean ((X - mean (X)).^4)
          k1 = ------------------------
                      std (X).^4

     The optional argument FLAG controls which normalization is used.  If FLAG is equal to 1 (default value, used when FLAG is omitted or empty), return the sample kurtosis as defined above.  If FLAG is equal to 0, return the "bias-corrected" kurtosis coefficient instead:

                        N - 1
          k0 = 3 + -------------- * ((N + 1) * k1 - 3 * (N - 1))
                   (N - 2)(N - 3)

     The bias-corrected kurtosis coefficient is obtained by replacing the sample second and fourth central moments by their unbiased versions.  It is an unbiased estimate of the population kurtosis for normal populations.

     If X is a matrix, or more generally a multi-dimensional array, return the kurtosis along the first non-singleton dimension.  If the optional DIM argument is given, operate along this dimension.

     Estimate X under the model B = AX + W, where the noise W is assumed to follow a normal distribution with covariance matrix {\sigma^2} V.

     If the size of the coefficient matrix A is n-by-p, the size of the vector/array of constant terms B must be n-by-k.

     The optional input argument V may be a n-by-1 vector of positive weights (inverse variances), or a n-by-n symmetric positive semidefinite matrix representing the covariance of B.  If V is not supplied, the ordinary least squares solution is returned.

     The ALG input argument, a guidance on solution method to use, is currently ignored.

     Besides the least-squares estimate matrix X (p-by-k), the function also returns STDX (p-by-k), the error standard deviation of estimated X; MSE (k-by-1), the estimated data error covariance scale factors (\sigma^2); and S (p-by-p, or p-by-p-by-k if k > 1), the error covariance of X.

 -- Function File: [BETA, SIGMA, R] = ols (Y, X)
     Ordinary least squares estimation.

     OLS applies to the multivariate model y = x*b + e with mean (e) = 0 and cov (vec (e)) = kron (s, I). where y is a t by p matrix, x is a t by k matrix, b is a k by p matrix, and e is a t by p matrix.

     Each row of Y and X is an observation and each column a variable.

     The return values BETA, SIGMA, and R are defined as follows.

     BETA
          The OLS estimator for b.  BETA is calculated directly via 'inv (x'*x) * x' * y' if the matrix 'x'*x' is of full rank.  Otherwise, 'BETA = pinv (X) * Y' where 'pinv (X)' denotes the pseudoinverse of X.

     SIGMA
          The OLS estimator for the matrix S,

               SIGMA = (Y-X*BETA)'
                 * (Y-X*BETA)
                 / (T-rank(X))

     R
          The matrix of OLS residuals, 'R = Y - X*BETA'.

     If F is the CDF of the distribution DIST with parameters PARAMS and X a sample vector of length N, the PP-plot graphs ordinate Y(I) = F (I-th largest element of X) versus abscissa P(I) = (I - 0.5)/N.  If the sample comes from F, the pairs will approximately follow a straight line.

     The default for DIST is the standard normal distribution.

     The optional argument PARAMS contains a list of parameters of DIST.

     For example, for a probability plot of the uniform distribution on [2,4] and X, use

          ppplot (x, "uniform", 2, 4)

     DIST can be any string for which a function DIST_CDF that calculates the CDF of distribution DIST exists.

 -- Function File: Q = quantile (X)
 -- Function File: Q = quantile (X, P)
 -- Function File: Q = quantile (X, P, DIM)
 -- Function File: Q = quantile (X, P, DIM, METHOD)
     For a sample, X, calculate the quantiles, Q, corresponding to the cumulative probability values in P.  All non-numeric values (NaNs) of X are ignored.

     If X is a matrix, compute the quantiles for each column and return them in a matrix, such that the i-th row of Q contains the P(i)th quantiles of each column of X.

     If P is unspecified, return the quantiles for '[0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00]'.  The optional argument DIM determines the dimension along which the quantiles are calculated.  If DIM is omitted it defaults to the first non-singleton dimension.

     The methods available to calculate sample quantiles are the nine methods used by R (<http://www.r-project.org/>).  The default value is METHOD = 5.

     Discontinuous sample quantile methods 1, 2, and 3

       1. Method 1: Inverse of empirical distribution function.

       2. Method 2: Similar to method 1 but with averaging at discontinuities.

       3. Method 3: SAS definition: nearest even order statistic.

     Continuous sample quantile methods 4 through 9, where p(k) is the linear interpolation function respecting each methods' representative cdf.

       4. Method 4: p(k) = k / n.  That is, linear interpolation of the empirical cdf.

       5. Method 5: p(k) = (k - 0.5) / n.  That is a piecewise linear function where the knots are the values midway through the steps of the empirical cdf.

       6. Method 6: p(k) = k / (n + 1).

       7. Method 7: p(k) = (k - 1) / (n - 1).

       8. Method 8: p(k) = (k - 1/3) / (n + 1/3).  The resulting quantile estimates are approximately median-unbiased regardless of the distribution of X.

       9. Method 9: p(k) = (k - 3/8) / (n + 1/4).  The resulting quantile estimates are approximately unbiased for the expected order statistics if X is normally distributed.

     Hyndman and Fan (1996) recommend method 8.  Maxima, S, and R (versions prior to 2.0.0) use 7 as their default.  Minitab and SPSS use method 6.  MATLAB uses method 5.

     Compute the sample skewness of the elements of X.

     The sample skewness is defined as

                         mean ((X - mean (X)).^3)
          skewness (X) = ------------------------.
                                std (X).^3

     The optional argument FLAG controls which normalization is used.  If FLAG is equal to 1 (default value, used when FLAG is omitted or empty), return the sample skewness as defined above.  If FLAG is equal to 0, return the adjusted skewness coefficient instead:

                            sqrt (N*(N-1))   mean ((X - mean (X)).^3)
          skewness (X, 0) = -------------- * ------------------------.
                                (N - 2)             std (X).^3

     The adjusted skewness coefficient is obtained by replacing the sample second and third central moments by their bias-corrected versions.

     If X is a matrix, or more generally a multi-dimensional array, return the skewness along the first non-singleton dimension.  If the optional DIM argument is given, operate along this dimension.

     Compute the standard deviation of the elements of the vector X.

     The standard deviation is defined as

          std (x) = sqrt ( 1/(N-1) SUM_i (x(i) - mean(x))^2 )

     where N is the number of elements.

     If X is a matrix, compute the standard deviation for each column and return them in a row vector.

     The argument OPT determines the type of normalization to use.  Valid values are

     0:
          normalize with N-1, provides the square root of the best unbiased estimator of the variance [default]

     1:
          normalize with N, this provides the square root of the second moment around the mean

     Compute the variance of the elements of the vector X.

     The variance is defined as

          var (x) = 1/(N-1) SUM_i (x(i) - mean(x))^2

     If X is a matrix, compute the variance for each column and return them in a row vector.

     The argument OPT determines the type of normalization to use.  Valid values are

     0:
          normalize with N-1, provides the best unbiased estimator of the variance [default]

     1:

 -- Function File: [THETA, BETA, DEV, DL, D2L, P] = logistic_regression (Y, X, PRINT, THETA, BETA)
     Perform ordinal logistic regression.

     Suppose Y takes values in K ordered categories, and let 'gamma_i (X)' be the cumulative probability that Y falls in one of the first I categories given the covariate X.  Then

          [theta, beta] = logistic_regression (y, x)

     fits the model

          logit (gamma_i (x)) = theta_i - beta' * x,   i = 1 ... k-1

     The number of ordinal categories, K, is taken to be the number of distinct values of 'round (Y)'.  If K equals 2, Y is binary and the model is ordinary logistic regression.  The matrix X is assumed to have full column rank.

     Given Y only, 'theta = logistic_regression (y)' fits the model with baseline logit odds only.

     The full form is

          [theta, beta, dev, dl, d2l, gamma]
             = logistic_regression (y, x, print, theta, beta)

     in which all output arguments and all input arguments except Y are optional.

     Setting PRINT to 1 requests summary information about the fitted model to be displayed.  Setting PRINT to 2 requests information about convergence at each iteration.  Other values request no information to be displayed.  The input arguments THETA and BETA give initial estimates for THETA and BETA.

     The returned value DEV holds minus twice the log-likelihood.

     The returned values DL and D2L are the vector of first and the matrix of second derivatives of the log-likelihood with respect to THETA and BETA.

     P holds estimates for the conditional distribution of Y given X.

     Perform a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).

     The goal is to test whether the population means of data taken from K different groups are all equal.

     Data may be given in a single vector Y with groups specified by a corresponding vector of group labels G (e.g., numbers from 1 to K).  This is the general form which does not impose any restriction on the number of data in each group or the group labels.

     If Y is a matrix and G is omitted, each column of Y is treated as a group.  This form is only appropriate for balanced ANOVA in which the numbers of samples from each group are all equal.

     Under the null of constant means, the statistic F follows an F distribution with DF_B and DF_W degrees of freedom.

     The p-value (1 minus the CDF of this distribution at F) is returned in PVAL.

     If no output argument is given, the standard one-way ANOVA table is printed.

 -- Function File: manova (X, G)
     Perform a one-way multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA).

     The goal is to test whether the p-dimensional population means of data taken from K different groups are all equal.  All data are assumed drawn independently from p-dimensional normal distributions with the same covariance matrix.

     The data matrix is given by X.  As usual, rows are observations and columns are variables.  The vector G specifies the corresponding group labels (e.g., numbers from 1 to K).

     The LR test statistic (Wilks' Lambda) and approximate p-values are computed and displayed.

 -- Function File: S = mat2str (X, N)
 -- Function File: S = mat2str (X, N, "class")
     Format real, complex, and logical matrices as strings.

     The returned string may be used to reconstruct the original matrix by using the 'eval' function.

     The precision of the values is given by N.  If N is a scalar then both real and imaginary parts of the matrix are printed to the same precision.  Otherwise 'N(1)' defines the precision of the real part and 'N(2)' defines the precision of the imaginary part.  The default for N is 15.

     If the argument "class" is given then the class of X is included in the string in such a way that 'eval' will result in the construction of a matrix of the same class.

          mat2str ([ -1/3 + i/7; 1/3 - i/7 ], [4 2])
               => "[-0.3333+0.14i;0.3333-0.14i]"

 -- Function File: [CSTR] = ostrsplit (S, SEP)
 -- Function File: [CSTR] = ostrsplit (S, SEP, STRIP_EMPTY)
     Split the string S using one or more separators SEP and return a cell array of strings.

     Consecutive separators and separators at boundaries result in empty strings, unless STRIP_EMPTY is true.  The default value of STRIP_EMPTY is false.

     2-D character arrays are split at separators and at the original column boundaries.

     Example:

          ostrsplit ("a,b,c", ",")
                =>
                    {
                      [1,1] = a

 -- Function File: regexptranslate (OP, S)
     Translate a string for use in a regular expression.

     This may include either wildcard replacement or special character escaping.

     The behavior is controlled by OP which can take the following values

     "wildcard"
          The wildcard characters '.', '*', and '?' are replaced with wildcards that are appropriate for a regular expression.  For example:

               regexptranslate ("wildcard", "*.m")
                    => ".*\.m"

     "escape"
          The characters '$.?[]', that have special meaning for regular expressions are escaped so that they are treated literally.  For example:

               regexptranslate ("escape", "12.5")
                    => "12\.5"

 -- Function File: rindex (S, T)
     Return the position of the last occurrence of the character string T in the character string S, or 0 if no occurrence is found.

     S may also be a string array or cell array of strings.

     For example:

          rindex ("Teststring", "t")
               => 6

     The 'rindex' function is equivalent to 'index' with DIRECTION set to "last".

# length: 774
 -- Function File: X = str2num (S)
 -- Function File: [X, STATE] = str2num (S)
     Convert the string (or character array) S to a number (or an array).

     Examples:

          str2num ("3.141596")
                => 3.141596

          str2num (["1, 2, 3"; "4, 5, 6"])
                => 1  2  3
                   4  5  6

     The optional second output, STATE, is logically true when the conversion is successful.  If the conversion fails the numeric output, X, is empty and STATE is false.

     *Caution:* As 'str2num' uses the 'eval' function to do the conversion, 'str2num' will execute any code contained in the string S.  Use 'str2double' for a safer and faster conversion.

     For cell array of strings use 'str2double'.

     See also: str2double, eval.

 -- Function File: strcat (S1, S2, ...)
     Return a string containing all the arguments concatenated horizontally.

     If the arguments are cell strings, 'strcat' returns a cell string with the individual cells concatenated.  For numerical input, each element is converted to the corresponding ASCII character.  Trailing white space for any character string input is eliminated before the strings are concatenated.  Note that cell string values do *not* have whitespace trimmed.

     For example:

          strcat ("|", " leading space is preserved", "|")
              => | leading space is preserved|

          strcat ("|", "trailing space is eliminated ", "|")
              => |trailing space is eliminated|

          strcat ("homogeneous space |", "  ", "| is also eliminated")
              => homogeneous space || is also eliminated

          s = [ "ab"; "cde" ];
          strcat (s, s, s)
              =>
                  "ababab   "
                  "cdecdecde"

          s = { "ab"; "cd " };
          strcat (s, s, s)
              =>
                  {
                    [1,1] = ababab

 -- Function File: [I, J] = strchr (...)
     Search for the string STR for occurrences of characters from the set CHARS.

     The return value(s), as well as the N and DIRECTION arguments behave identically as in 'find'.

     This will be faster than using regexp in most cases.

 -- Function File: STR = strjoin (CSTR)
 -- Function File: STR = strjoin (CSTR, DELIMITER)
     Join the elements of the cell string array, CSTR, into a single string.

     If no DELIMITER is specified, the elements of CSTR are separated by a space.

     If DELIMITER is specified as a string, the cell string array is joined using the string.  Escape sequences are supported.

     If DELIMITER is a cell string array whose length is one less than CSTR, then the elements of CSTR are joined by interleaving the cell string elements of DELIMITER.  Escape sequences are not supported.

          strjoin ({'Octave','Scilab','Lush','Yorick'}, '*')
                => 'Octave*Scilab*Lush*Yorick'

     Return the text, S, justified according to POS, which may be "left", "center", or "right".

     If POS is omitted it defaults to "right".

     Null characters are replaced by spaces.  All other character data are treated as non-white space.

     Example:

          strjust (["a"; "ab"; "abc"; "abcd"])
               =>
                  "   a"

 -- Function File: strmatch (S, A)
 -- Function File: strmatch (S, A, "exact")
     Return indices of entries of A which begin with the string S.

     The second argument A must be a string, character matrix, or a cell array of strings.

     If the third argument "exact" is not given, then S only needs to match A up to the length of S.  Trailing spaces and nulls in S and A are ignored when matching.

     For example:

          strmatch ("apple", "apple juice")
               => 1

          strmatch ("apple", ["apple  "; "apple juice"; "an apple"])
               => [1; 2]

          strmatch ("apple", ["apple  "; "apple juice"; "an apple"], "exact")
               => [1]

     *Caution:* 'strmatch' is scheduled for deprecation.  Use 'strncmp' (normal case), or 'strcmp' ("exact" case), or 'regexp' in all new code.

 -- Function File: [CSTR] = strsplit (STR, DEL)
 -- Function File: [CSTR] = strsplit (..., NAME, VALUE)
 -- Function File: [CSTR, MATCHES] = strsplit (...)
     Split the string STR using the delimiters specified by DEL and return a cell string array of substrings.

     If a delimiter is not specified the string is split at whitespace '{" ", "\f", "\n", "\r", "\t", "\v"}'.  Otherwise, the delimiter, DEL must be a string or cell array of strings.  By default, consecutive delimiters in the input string S are collapsed into one resulting in a single split.

     Supported NAME/VALUE pair arguments are:

        * COLLAPSEDELIMITERS which may take the value of 'true' (default) or 'false'.

        * DELIMITERTYPE which may take the value of "simple" (default) or "regularexpression".  A simple delimiter matches the text exactly as written.  Otherwise, the syntax for regular expressions outlined in 'regexp' is used.

     The optional second output, MATCHES, returns the delimiters which were matched in the original string.

     Examples with simple delimiters:

          strsplit ("a b c")
                =>

 -- Function File: [TOK, REM] = strtok (STR)
 -- Function File: [TOK, REM] = strtok (STR, DELIM)

     Find all characters in the string STR up to, but not including, the first character which is in the string DELIM.

     STR may also be a cell array of strings in which case the function executes on every individual string and returns a cell array of tokens and remainders.

     Leading delimiters are ignored.  If DELIM is not specified, whitespace is assumed.

     If REM is requested, it contains the remainder of the string, starting at the first delimiter.

     Examples:

          strtok ("this is the life")
               => "this"

          [tok, rem] = strtok ("14*27+31", "+-*/")
               =>
                  tok = 14
                  rem = *27+31

 -- Function File: strtrim (S)
     Remove leading and trailing whitespace from S.

     If S is a matrix, STRTRIM trims each row to the length of longest string.  If S is a cell array of strings, operate recursively on each string element.

     For example:

          strtrim ("    abc  ")
               =>  "abc"

          strtrim ([" abc   "; "   def   "])
               =>  ["abc  "  ; "  def"]

 -- Function File: substr (S, OFFSET)
 -- Function File: substr (S, OFFSET, LEN)
     Return the substring of S which starts at character number OFFSET and is LEN characters long.

     Position numbering for offsets begins with 1.  If OFFSET is negative, extraction starts that far from the end of the string.

     If LEN is omitted, the substring extends to the end of S.  A negative value for LEN extracts to within LEN characters of the end of the string

     Examples:

          substr ("This is a test string", 6, 9)
               => "is a test"
          substr ("This is a test string", -11)
               => "test string"
          substr ("This is a test string", -11, -7)
               => "test"

     This function is patterned after the equivalent function in Perl.

 -- Function File: untabify (T)
 -- Function File: untabify (T, TW)
 -- Function File: untabify (T, TW, DEBLANK)
     Replace TAB characters in T with spaces.

     The input, T, may be either a 2-D character array, or a cell array of character strings.  The output is the same class as the input.

     The tab width is specified by TW, and defaults to eight.

     If the optional argument DEBLANK is true, then the spaces will be removed from the end of the character data.

     The following example reads a file and writes an untabified version of the same file with trailing spaces stripped.

          fid = fopen ("tabbed_script.m");
          text = char (fread (fid, "uchar")');
          fclose (fid);
          fid = fopen ("untabified_script.m", "w");
          text = untabify (strsplit (text, "\n"), 8, true);
          fprintf (fid, "%s\n", text{:});
          fclose (fid);

 -- Function File: VALIDSTR = validatestring (STR, STRARRAY)
 -- Function File: VALIDSTR = validatestring (STR, STRARRAY, FUNCNAME)
 -- Function File: VALIDSTR = validatestring (STR, STRARRAY, FUNCNAME, VARNAME)
 -- Function File: VALIDSTR = validatestring (..., POSITION)
     Verify that STR is an element, or substring of an element, in STRARRAY.

     When STR is a character string to be tested, and STRARRAY is a cellstr of valid values, then VALIDSTR will be the validated form of STR where validation is defined as STR being a member or substring of VALIDSTR.  This is useful for both verifying and expanding short options, such as "r", to their longer forms, such as "red".  If STR is a substring of VALIDSTR, and there are multiple matches, the shortest match will be returned if all matches are substrings of each other.  Otherwise, an error will be raised because the expansion of STR is ambiguous.  All comparisons are case insensitive.

     The additional inputs FUNCNAME, VARNAME, and POSITION are optional and will make any generated validation error message more specific.

     Examples:

          validatestring ("r", {"red", "green", "blue"})
          => "red"

          validatestring ("b", {"red", "green", "blue", "black"})
          => error: validatestring: multiple unique matches were found for 'b':
             blue, black

     Produce an error if the specified condition is not met.

     'assert' can be called in three different ways.

     'assert (COND)'
     'assert (COND, ERRMSG)'
     'assert (COND, ERRMSG, ...)'
     'assert (COND, MSG_ID, ERRMSG, ...)'
          Called with a single argument COND, 'assert' produces an error if COND is false (numeric zero).

          Any additional arguments are passed to the 'error' function for processing.

     'assert (OBSERVED, EXPECTED)'
          Produce an error if observed is not the same as expected.

          Note that OBSERVED and EXPECTED can be scalars, vectors, matrices, strings, cell arrays, or structures.

     'assert (OBSERVED, EXPECTED, TOL)'
          Produce an error if observed is not the same as expected but equality comparison for numeric data uses a tolerance TOL.

          If TOL is positive then it is an absolute tolerance which will produce an error if 'abs (OBSERVED - EXPECTED) > abs (TOL)'.

          If TOL is negative then it is a relative tolerance which will produce an error if 'abs (OBSERVED - EXPECTED) > abs (TOL * EXPECTED)'.

          If EXPECTED is zero TOL will always be interpreted as an absolute tolerance.

          If TOL is not scalar its dimensions must agree with those of OBSERVED and EXPECTED and tests are performed on an element-by-element basis.

 -- Command: demo NAME
 -- Command: demo NAME N
 -- Function File: demo ("NAME")
 -- Function File: demo ("NAME", N)

     Run example code block N associated with the function NAME.

     If N is not specified, all examples are run.

     The preferred location for example code blocks is embedded within the script m-file immediately following the code that it exercises.  Alternatively, the examples may be stored in a file with the same name but no extension located on Octave's load path.  To separate examples from regular script code all lines are prefixed by '%!'.  Each example must also be introduced by the keyword "demo" flush left to the prefix with no intervening spaces.  The remainder of the example can contain arbitrary Octave code.  For example:

          %!demo
          %! t = 0:0.01:2*pi;
          %! x = sin (t);
          %! plot (t, x);
          %! title ("one cycle of a sine wave");
          %! #-------------------------------------------------
          %! # the figure window shows one cycle of a sine wave

     Note that the code is displayed before it is executed so that a simple comment at the end suffices for labeling what is being shown.  For plots, labeling can also be done with 'title' or 'text'.  It is generally *not* necessary to use 'disp' or 'printf' within the demo.

     Demos are run in a stand-alone function environment with no access to external variables.  This means that every demo must have separate initialization code.  Alternatively, all demos can be combined into a single large demo with the code

          %! input ("Press <enter> to continue: ", "s");

     between the sections, but this usage is discouraged.  Other techniques to avoid multiple initialization blocks include using multiple plots with a new 'figure' command between each plot, or using 'subplot' to put multiple plots in the same window.

     Finally, because 'demo' evaluates within a function context it is not possible to define new functions within the code.  Anonymous functions make a good substitute in most instances.  If function blocks *must* be used then the code 'eval (example ("function", n))' will allow Octave to see them.  This has its own problems, however, as 'eval' only evaluates one line or statement at a time.  In this case the function declaration must be wrapped with "if 1 <demo stuff> endif" where "if" is on the same line as "demo".  For example:

          %!demo if 1
          %!  function y = f(x)
          %!    y = x;
          %!  endfunction
          %!  f(3)
          %! endif

 -- Function File: fail (CODE)

 -- Function File: fail (CODE, "warning")
 -- Function File: fail (CODE, "warning", PATTERN)

     Return true if CODE fails with an error message matching PATTERN, otherwise produce an error.

     CODE must be in the form of a string that is passed to the Octave interpreter via the 'evalin' function, i.e., a (quoted) string constant or a string variable.

     Note that if CODE runs successfully, rather than failing, the error printed is:

                    expected error <.> but got none

     If called with two arguments, the return value will be true only if CODE fails with an error message containing PATTERN (case sensitive).  If the code fails with a different error than the one specified in PATTERN then the message produced is:

                    expected <PATTERN>
                    but got <text of actual error>

     The angle brackets are not part of the output.

     When called with the "warning" option 'fail' will produce an error if executing the code produces no warning.

 -- Function File: speed (F, INIT, MAX_N, F2, TOL)
 -- Function File: [ORDER, N, T_F, T_F2] = speed (...)

     Determine the execution time of an expression (F) for various input values (N).

     The N are log-spaced from 1 to MAX_N.  For each N, an initialization expression (INIT) is computed to create any data needed for the test.  If a second expression (F2) is given then the execution times of the two expressions are compared.  When called without output arguments the results are printed to stdout and displayed graphically.

     'F'
          The code expression to evaluate.

     'MAX_N'
          The maximum test length to run.  The default value is 100.  Alternatively, use '[min_n, max_n]' or specify the N exactly with '[n1, n2, ..., nk]'.

     'INIT'
          Initialization expression for function argument values.  Use K for the test number and N for the size of the test.  This should compute values for all variables used by F.  Note that INIT will be evaluated first for k = 0, so things which are constant throughout the test series can be computed once.  The default value is 'X = randn (N, 1)'.

     'F2'
          An alternative expression to evaluate, so that the speed of two expressions can be directly compared.  The default is '[]'.

     'TOL'
          Tolerance used to compare the results of expression F and expression F2.  If TOL is positive, the tolerance is an absolute one.  If TOL is negative, the tolerance is a relative one.  The default is 'eps'.  If TOL is 'Inf', then no comparison will be made.

     'ORDER'
          The time complexity of the expression O(a*n^p).  This is a structure with fields 'a' and 'p'.

     'N'
          The values N for which the expression was calculated *AND* the execution time was greater than zero.

     'T_F'
          The nonzero execution times recorded for the expression F in seconds.

     'T_F2'
          The nonzero execution times recorded for the expression F2 in seconds.  If required, the mean time ratio is simply 'mean (T_f ./ T_f2)'.

     The slope of the execution time graph shows the approximate power of the asymptotic running time O(n^p).  This power is plotted for the region over which it is approximated (the latter half of the graph).  The estimated power is not very accurate, but should be sufficient to determine the general order of an algorithm.  It should indicate if, for example, the implementation is unexpectedly O(n^2) rather than O(n) because it extends a vector each time through the loop rather than pre-allocating storage.  In the current version of Octave, the following is not the expected O(n).

          speed ("for i = 1:n, y{i} = x(i); endfor", "", [1000, 10000])

     But it is if you preallocate the cell array 'y':

          speed ("for i = 1:n, y{i} = x(i); endfor", ...
                 "x = rand (n, 1); y = cell (size (x));", [1000, 10000])

     An attempt is made to approximate the cost of individual operations, but it is wildly inaccurate.  You can improve the stability somewhat by doing more work for each 'n'.  For example:

          speed ("airy(x)", "x = rand (n, 10)", [10000, 100000])

     When comparing two different expressions (F, F2), the slope of the line on the speedup ratio graph should be larger than 1 if the new expression is faster.  Better algorithms have a shallow slope.  Generally, vectorizing an algorithm will not change the slope of the execution time graph, but will shift it relative to the original.  For example:

          speed ("sum (x)", "", [10000, 100000], ...
                 "v = 0; for i = 1:length (x), v += x(i); endfor")

     The following is a more complex example.  If there was an original version of 'xcorr' using for loops and a second version using an FFT, then one could compare the run speed for various lags as follows, or for a fixed lag with varying vector lengths as follows:

          speed ("xcorr (x, n)", "x = rand (128, 1);", 100,
                 "xcorr_orig (x, n)", -100*eps)
          speed ("xcorr (x, 15)", "x = rand (20+n, 1);", 100,
                 "xcorr_orig (x, n)", -100*eps)

     Assuming one of the two versions is in xcorr_orig, this would compare their speed and their output values.  Note that the FFT version is not exact, so one must specify an acceptable tolerance on the comparison '100*eps'.  In this case, the comparison should be computed relatively, as 'abs ((X - Y) ./ Y)' rather than absolutely as 'abs (X - Y)'.

     Type 'example ("speed")' to see some real examples or 'demo ("speed")' to run them.

 -- Function File: test ([], "explain", FID)
 -- Function File: test ([], "explain", FNAME)

     Perform built-in self-tests from the first file in the loadpath matching NAME.

     'test' can be called in either command or functional form.  The exact operation of test is determined by a combination of mode (interactive or batch), reporting level ("quiet", "normal", "verbose"), and whether a logfile or summary output variable is used.

     The default mode when 'test' is called from the command line is interactive.  In this mode, tests will be run until the first error is encountered, or all tests complete successfully.  In batch mode, all tests are run regardless of any failures, and the results are collected for reporting.  Tests which require user interaction, i.e., demo blocks, are never run in batch mode.

     Batch mode is enabled by either 1) specifying a logfile using the third argument FNAME or FID, or 2) requesting an output argument such as SUCCESS, N, etc.

     The optional second argument determines the amount of output to generate and which types of tests to run.  The default value is "normal".  Requesting an output argument will suppress printing the final summary message and any intermediate warnings, unless verbose reporting is enabled.

     "quiet"
          Print a summary message when all tests pass, or print an error with the results of the first bad test when a failure occurs.  Don't run tests which require user interaction.

     "normal"
          Display warning messages about skipped tests or failing xtests during test execution.  Print a summary message when all tests pass, or print an error with the results of the first bad test when a failure occurs.  Don't run tests which require user interaction.

     "verbose"
          Display tests before execution.  Print all warning messages.  In interactive mode, run all tests including those which require user interaction.

     The optional third input argument specifies a logfile where results of the tests should be written.  The logfile may be a character string (FNAME) or an open file descriptor ID (FID).  To enable batch processing, but still print the results to the screen, use 'stdout' for FID.

     When called with just a single output argument SUCCESS, 'test' returns true if all of the tests were successful.  If called with more than one output argument then the number of successful tests (N), the total number of tests in the file (NMAX), the number of xtest failures (NXFAIL), and the number of skipped tests (NSKIP are returned.

     Example

          test sind
          =>
          PASSES 5 out of 5 tests

          [n, nmax] = test ("sind")
          =>
          n =  5
          nmax =  5

     Additional Calling Syntaxes

     If the second argument is the string "grabdemo", the contents of any built-in demo blocks are extracted but not executed.  The text for all code blocks is concatenated and returned as CODE with IDX being a vector of positions of the ends of each demo block.  For an easier way to extract demo blocks from files, *Note example: XREFexample.

     If the second argument is "explain" then NAME is ignored and an explanation of the line markers used in 'test' output reports is written to the file specified by FNAME or FID.

 -- Function File: asctime (TM_STRUCT)
     Convert a time structure to a string using the following format: "ddd mmm mm HH:MM:SS yyyy\n".

     For example:

          asctime (localtime (time ()))
               => "Mon Feb 17 01:15:06 1997\n"

     This is equivalent to 'ctime (time ())'.

 -- Function File: C = calendar ()
 -- Function File: C = calendar (D)
 -- Function File: C = calendar (Y, M)
 -- Function File: calendar (...)
     Return the current monthly calendar in a 6x7 matrix.

     If D is specified, return the calendar for the month containing the date D, which must be a serial date number or a date string.

     If Y and M are specified, return the calendar for year Y and month M.

     If no output arguments are specified, print the calendar on the screen instead of returning a matrix.

 -- Function File: clock ()
     Return the current local date and time as a date vector.

     The date vector contains the following fields: current year, month (1-12), day (1-31), hour (0-23), minute (0-59), and second (0-61).  The seconds field has a fractional part after the decimal point for extended accuracy.

     For example:

          fix (clock ())
               => [ 1993, 8, 20, 4, 56, 1 ]

     'clock' is more accurate on systems that have the 'gettimeofday' function.

 -- Function File: ctime (T)
     Convert a value returned from 'time' (or any other non-negative integer), to the local time and return a string of the same form as 'asctime'.

     The function 'ctime (time)' is equivalent to 'asctime (localtime (time))'.  For example:

          ctime (time ())
             => "Mon Feb 17 01:15:06 1997\n"

 -- Function File: [DAYS, SECS] = datenum (...)
     Return the date/time input as a serial day number, with Jan 1, 0000 defined as day 1.

     The integer part, 'floor (DAYS)' counts the number of complete days in the date input.

     The fractional part, 'rem (DAYS, 1)' corresponds to the time on the given day.

     The input may be a date vector (see 'datevec'), datestr (see 'datestr'), or directly specified as input.

     When processing input datestrings, F is the format string used to interpret date strings (see 'datestr').  If no format F is specified, then a relatively slow search is performed through various formats.  It is always preferable to specify the format string F if it is known.  Formats which do not specify a particular time component will have the value set to zero.  Formats which do not specify a date will default to January 1st of the current year.

     P is the year at the start of the century to which two-digit years will be referenced.  If not specified, it defaults to the current year minus 50.

     The optional output SECS holds the time on the specified day with greater precision than DAYS.

     Notes:

        * Years can be negative and/or fractional.

        * Months below 1 are considered to be January.

        * Days of the month start at 1.

        * Days beyond the end of the month go into subsequent months.

        * Days before the beginning of the month go to the previous month.

        * Days can be fractional.

     *Caution:* this function does not attempt to handle Julian calendars so dates before October 15, 1582 are wrong by as much as eleven days.  Also, be aware that only Roman Catholic countries adopted the calendar in 1582.  It took until 1924 for it to be adopted everywhere.  See the Wikipedia entry on the Gregorian calendar for more details.

     *Warning:* leap seconds are ignored.  A table of leap seconds is available on the Wikipedia entry for leap seconds.

     Format the given date/time according to the format 'f' and return the result in STR.

     DATE is a serial date number (see 'datenum') or a date vector (see 'datevec').  The value of DATE may also be a string or cell array of strings.

     F can be an integer which corresponds to one of the codes in the table below, or a date format string.

     P is the year at the start of the century in which two-digit years are to be interpreted in.  If not specified, it defaults to the current year minus 50.

     For example, the date 730736.65149 (2000-09-07 15:38:09.0934) would be formatted as follows:

     Convert a serial date number (see 'datenum') or date string (see 'datestr') into a date vector.

     A date vector is a row vector with six members, representing the year, month, day, hour, minute, and seconds respectively.

     F is the format string used to interpret date strings (see 'datestr').  If DATE is a string, but no format is specified, then a relatively slow search is performed through various formats.  It is always preferable to specify the format string F if it is known.  Formats which do not specify a particular time component will have the value set to zero.  Formats which do not specify a date will default to January 1st of the current year.

     P is the year at the start of the century to which two-digit years will be referenced.  If not specified, it defaults to the current year minus 50.

     Query or set the internal variable that controls whether Octave will automatically mutate sparse matrices to full matrices to save memory.

     For example:

          s = speye (3);
          sparse_auto_mutate (false);
          s(:, 1) = 1;
          typeinfo (s)

          sparse_auto_mutate (true);
          s(1, :) = 1;
          typeinfo (s)
          => matrix

     When called from inside a function with the "local" option, the variable is changed locally for the function and any subroutines it calls.  The original variable value is restored when exiting the function.

 -- Built-in Function: C = struct2cell (S)
     Create a new cell array from the objects stored in the struct object.

     If F is the number of fields in the structure, the resulting cell array will have a dimension vector corresponding to '[F size(S)]'.  For example:

          s = struct ("name", {"Peter", "Hannah", "Robert"},
                     "age", {23, 16, 3});
          c = struct2cell (s)

               The function is anonymous.

          private
               The function is private.

          overloaded
               The function overloads an existing function.

          simple
               The function is a built-in or m-file function.

          subfunction
               The function is a subfunction within an m-file.

     file
          The m-file that will be called to perform the function.  This field is empty for anonymous and built-in functions.

     In addition, some function types may return more information in additional fields.

 -- Built-in Function: inline (STR)
 -- Built-in Function: inline (STR, ARG1, ...)
 -- Built-in Function: inline (STR, N)
     Create an inline function from the character string STR.

     If called with a single argument, the arguments of the generated function are extracted from the function itself.  The generated function arguments will then be in alphabetical order.  It should be noted that i and j are ignored as arguments due to the ambiguity between their use as a variable or their use as an built-in constant.  All arguments followed by a parenthesis are considered to be functions.  If no arguments are found, a function taking a single argument named 'x' will be created.

     If the second and subsequent arguments are character strings, they are the names of the arguments of the function.

     If the second argument is an integer N, the arguments are "x", "P1", ..., "PN".

     Programming Note: The use of 'inline' is discouraged and it may be removed from a future version of Octave.  The preferred way to create functions from strings is through the use of anonymous functions (*note Anonymous Functions::) or 'str2func'.

 -- Built-in Function: S = struct ()
 -- Built-in Function: S = struct (FIELD1, VALUE1, FIELD2, VALUE2, ...)
 -- Built-in Function: S = struct (OBJ)

     Create a scalar or array structure and initialize its values.

     The FIELD1, FIELD2, ... variables are strings specifying the names of the fields and the VALUE1, VALUE2, ... variables can be of any type.

     If the values are cell arrays, create a structure array and initialize its values.  The dimensions of each cell array of values must match.  Singleton cells and non-cell values are repeated so that they fill the entire array.  If the cells are empty, create an empty structure array with the specified field names.

     If the argument is an object, return the underlying struct.

     Observe that the syntax is optimized for struct *arrays*.  Consider the following examples:

          struct ("foo", 1)
            => scalar structure containing the fields:
              foo =  1

          struct ("foo", {})
            => 0x0 struct array containing the fields:
              foo

          struct ("foo", { {} })
            => scalar structure containing the fields:
              foo = {}(0x0)

          struct ("foo", {1, 2, 3})
            => 1x3 struct array containing the fields:
              foo


     The first case is an ordinary scalar struct--one field, one value.  The second produces an empty struct array with one field and no values, since being passed an empty cell array of struct array values.  When the value is a cell array containing a single entry, this becomes a scalar struct with that single entry as the value of the field.  That single entry happens to be an empty cell array.

     Finally, if the value is a non-scalar cell array, then 'struct' produces a struct *array*.

     Report the number of input arguments to a function.

     Called from within a function, return the number of arguments passed to the function.  At the top level, return the number of command line arguments passed to Octave.

     If called with the optional argument FCN--a function name or handle-- return the declared number of arguments that the function can accept.

     If the last argument to FCN is VARARGIN the returned value is negative.  For example, the function 'union' for sets is declared as

          function [y, ia, ib] = union (a, b, varargin)

          and

          nargin ("union")
          => -3

     Programming Note: 'nargin' does not work on built-in functions.

 -- Built-in Function: nargout ()
 -- Built-in Function: nargout (FCN)
     Report the number of output arguments from a function.

     Called from within a function, return the number of values the caller expects to receive.  At the top level, 'nargout' with no argument is undefined and will produce an error.

     If called with the optional argument FCN--a function name or handle--return the number of declared output values that the function can produce.

     If the final output argument is VARARGOUT the returned value is negative.

     For example,

          f ()

     will cause 'nargout' to return 0 inside the function 'f' and

          [s, t] = f ()

     will cause 'nargout' to return 2 inside the function 'f'.

     In the second usage,

          nargout (@histc) % or nargout ("histc")

     will return 2, because 'histc' has two outputs, whereas

          nargout (@imread)

     will return -2, because 'imread' has two outputs and the second is VARARGOUT.

     Programming Note.  'nargout' does not work for built-in functions and returns -1 for all anonymous functions.

     Within a function, return a logical value indicating whether the argument K will be assigned to a variable on output.

     If the result is false, the argument has been ignored during the function call through the use of the tilde (~) special output argument.  Functions can use 'isargout' to avoid performing unnecessary calculations for outputs which are unwanted.

     If K is outside the range '1:max (nargout)', the function returns false.  K can also be an array, in which case the function works element-by-element and a logical array is returned.  At the top level, 'isargout' returns an error.

 -- Built-in Function: subsref (VAL, IDX)
     Perform the subscripted element selection operation according to the subscript specified by IDX.

     The subscript IDX is expected to be a structure array with fields 'type' and 'subs'.  Valid values for 'type' are '"()"', '"{}"', and '"."'.  The 'subs' field may be either '":"' or a cell array of index values.

     The following example shows how to set the two first columns of a 3-by-3 matrix to zero.

          val = magic (3);
          idx.type = "()";
          idx.subs = {":", 1:2};

     Query or set the internal variable that controls whether Octave will do short-circuit evaluation of '|' and '&' operators inside the conditions of if or while statements.

     This feature is only provided for compatibility with MATLAB and should not be used unless you are porting old code that relies on this feature.

     To obtain short-circuit behavior for logical expressions in new programs, you should always use the '&&' and '||' operators.

     When called from inside a function with the "local" option, the variable is changed locally for the function and any subroutines it calls.  The original variable value is restored when exiting the function.

 -- Built-in Function: [D, P, AA] = balance (A, OPT)
 -- Built-in Function: [CC, DD, AA, BB] = balance (A, B, OPT)

     Balance the matrix A to reduce numerical errors in future calculations.

     Compute 'AA = DD \ A * DD' in which AA is a matrix whose row and column norms are roughly equal in magnitude, and 'DD = P * D', in which P is a permutation matrix and D is a diagonal matrix of powers of two.  This allows the equilibration to be computed without round-off.  Results of eigenvalue calculation are typically improved by balancing first.

     If two output values are requested, 'balance' returns the diagonal D and the permutation P separately as vectors.  In this case, 'DD = eye(n)(:,P) * diag (D)', where n is the matrix size.

     If four output values are requested, compute 'AA = CC*A*DD' and 'BB = CC*B*DD', in which AA and BB have nonzero elements of approximately the same magnitude and CC and DD are permuted diagonal matrices as in DD for the algebraic eigenvalue problem.

     The eigenvalue balancing option OPT may be one of:

     "noperm", "S"
          Scale only; do not permute.

     "noscal", "P"
          Permute only; do not scale.

     Algebraic eigenvalue balancing uses standard LAPACK routines.

     Generalized eigenvalue problem balancing uses Ward's algorithm (SIAM Journal on Scientific and Statistical Computing, 1981).

     Compute Bessel or Hankel functions of various kinds:

     'besselj'
          Bessel functions of the first kind.  If the argument OPT is 1 or true, the result is multiplied by 'exp (-abs (imag (X)))'.

     'bessely'
          Bessel functions of the second kind.  If the argument OPT is 1 or true, the result is multiplied by 'exp (-abs (imag (X)))'.

     'besseli'

          Modified Bessel functions of the first kind.  If the argument OPT is 1 or true, the result is multiplied by 'exp (-abs (real (X)))'.

     'besselk'

          Modified Bessel functions of the second kind.  If the argument OPT is 1 or true, the result is multiplied by 'exp (X)'.

     'besselh'
          Compute Hankel functions of the first (K = 1) or second (K = 2) kind.  If the argument OPT is 1 or true, the result is multiplied by 'exp (-I*X)' for K = 1 or 'exp (I*X)' for K = 2.

     If ALPHA is a scalar, the result is the same size as X.  If X is a scalar, the result is the same size as ALPHA.  If ALPHA is a row vector and X is a column vector, the result is a matrix with 'length (X)' rows and 'length (ALPHA)' columns.  Otherwise, ALPHA and X must conform and the result will be the same size.

     The value of ALPHA must be real.  The value of X may be complex.

     If requested, IERR contains the following status information and is the same size as the result.

       0. Normal return.

       1. Input error, return 'NaN'.

       2. Overflow, return 'Inf'.

       3. Loss of significance by argument reduction results in less than half of machine accuracy.

       4. Complete loss of significance by argument reduction, return 'NaN'.

       5. Error--no computation, algorithm termination condition not met, return 'NaN'.

     'numel'
     'prodofsize'
          Return the number of elements contained within each cell element.  The number is the product of the dimensions of the object at each cell element.

     'size'
          Return the size along the K-th dimension.

     'isclass'
          Return 1 for elements of CLASS.

     Additionally, 'cellfun' accepts an arbitrary function FUNC in the form of an inline function, function handle, or the name of a function (in a character string).  The function can take one or more arguments, with the inputs arguments given by C, D, etc.  Equally the function can return one or more output arguments.  For example:

          cellfun ("atan2", {1, 0}, {0, 1})
               => [ 1.57080   0.00000 ]

     The number of output arguments of 'cellfun' matches the number of output arguments of the function.  The outputs of the function will be collected into the output arguments of 'cellfun' like this:

          function [a, b] = twoouts (x)
            a = x;
            b = x*x;
          endfunction
          [aa, bb] = cellfun (@twoouts, {1, 2, 3})
               =>
                  aa =
                     1 2 3
                  bb =
                     1 4 9

     Note that per default the output argument(s) are arrays of the same size as the input arguments.  Input arguments that are singleton (1x1) cells will be automatically expanded to the size of the other arguments.

     If the parameter "UniformOutput" is set to true (the default), then the function must return scalars which will be concatenated into the return array(s).  If "UniformOutput" is false, the outputs are concatenated into a cell array (or cell arrays).  For example:

          cellfun ("tolower", {"Foo", "Bar", "FooBar"},
                   "UniformOutput", false)
          => {"foo", "bar", "foobar"}

     Given the parameter "ErrorHandler", then ERRFUNC defines a function to call in case FUNC generates an error.  The form of the function is

          function [...] = errfunc (S, ...)

     where there is an additional input argument to ERRFUNC relative to FUNC, given by S.  This is a structure with the elements "identifier", "message" and "index", giving respectively the error identifier, the error message, and the index into the input arguments of the element that caused the error.  For example:

          function y = foo (s, x), y = NaN; endfunction
          cellfun ("factorial", {-1,2}, "ErrorHandler", @foo)
          => [NaN 2]

     Use 'cellfun' intelligently.  The 'cellfun' function is a useful tool for avoiding loops.  It is often used with anonymous function handles; however, calling an anonymous function involves an overhead quite comparable to the overhead of an m-file function.  Passing a handle to a built-in function is faster, because the interpreter is not involved in the internal loop.  For example:

          a = {...}
          v = cellfun (@(x) det (x), a); # compute determinants
          v = cellfun (@det, a); # faster

 -- Function File: arrayfun (FUNC, A)

 -- Function File: X = arrayfun (FUNC, A, B, ...)
 -- Function File: [X, Y, ...] = arrayfun (FUNC, A, ...)
 -- Function File: arrayfun (..., "UniformOutput", VAL)
 -- Function File: arrayfun (..., "ErrorHandler", ERRFUNC)

     Execute a function on each element of an array.

     This is useful for functions that do not accept array arguments.  If the function does accept array arguments it is better to call the function directly.

     The first input argument FUNC can be a string, a function handle, an inline function, or an anonymous function.  The input argument A can be a logic array, a numeric array, a string array, a structure array, or a cell array.  By a call of the function 'arrayfun' all elements of A are passed on to the named function FUNC individually.

     The named function can also take more than two input arguments, with the input arguments given as third input argument B, fourth input argument C, ... If given more than one array input argument then all input arguments must have the same sizes, for example:

          arrayfun (@atan2, [1, 0], [0, 1])
               => [ 1.5708   0.0000 ]

     If the parameter VAL after a further string input argument "UniformOutput" is set 'true' (the default), then the named function FUNC must return a single element which then will be concatenated into the return value and is of type matrix.  Otherwise, if that parameter is set to 'false', then the outputs are concatenated in a cell array.  For example:

          arrayfun (@(x,y) x:y, "abc", "def", "UniformOutput", false)
          =>
             {
               [1,1] = abcd
               [1,2] = bcde
               [1,3] = cdef
             }

     If more than one output arguments are given then the named function must return the number of return values that also are expected, for example:

          [A, B, C] = arrayfun (@find, [10; 0], "UniformOutput", false)
          =>
          A =
          {
             [1,1] =  1
             [2,1] = [](0x0)
          }
          B =
          {
             [1,1] =  1
             [2,1] = [](0x0)
          }
          C =
          {
             [1,1] =  10
             [2,1] = [](0x0)
          }

     If the parameter ERRFUNC after a further string input argument "ErrorHandler" is another string, a function handle, an inline function, or an anonymous function, then ERRFUNC defines a function to call in the case that FUNC generates an error.  The definition of the function must be of the form

          function [...] = errfunc (S, ...)

     where there is an additional input argument to ERRFUNC relative to FUNC, given by S.  This is a structure with the elements "identifier", "message", and "index" giving, respectively, the error identifier, the error message, and the index of the array elements that caused the error.  The size of the output argument of ERRFUNC must have the same size as the output argument of FUNC, otherwise a real error is thrown.  For example:

          function y = ferr (s, x), y = "MyString"; endfunction
          arrayfun (@str2num, [1234],
                    "UniformOutput", false, "ErrorHandler", @ferr)
          =>
             {
               [1,1] = MyString
             }

 -- Built-in Function: C = mat2cell (A, M, N)
 -- Built-in Function: C = mat2cell (A, D1, D2, ...)
 -- Built-in Function: C = mat2cell (A, R)
     Convert the matrix A to a cell array.

     If A is 2-D, then it is required that 'sum (M) == size (A, 1)' and 'sum (N) == size (A, 2)'.  Similarly, if A is multi-dimensional and the number of dimensional arguments is equal to the dimensions of A, then it is required that 'sum (DI) == size (A, i)'.

     Given a single dimensional argument R, the other dimensional arguments are assumed to equal 'size (A,I)'.

     An example of the use of mat2cell is

          mat2cell (reshape (1:16,4,4), [3,1], [3,1])

 -- Built-in Function: SL = cellslices (X, LB, UB, DIM)
     Given an array X, this function produces a cell array of slices from the array determined by the index vectors LB, UB, for lower and upper bounds, respectively.

     In other words, it is equivalent to the following code:

          n = length (lb);
          sl = cell (1, n);
          for i = 1:length (lb)
            sl{i} = x(:,...,lb(i):ub(i),...,:);
          endfor

     The position of the index is determined by DIM.  If not specified, slicing is done along the first non-singleton dimension.

 -- Built-in Function: daspk_options (OPT, VAL)
     Query or set options for the function 'daspk'.

     When called with no arguments, the names of all available options and their current values are displayed.

     Given one argument, return the value of the option OPT.

     When called with two arguments, 'daspk_options' sets the option OPT to value VAL.

     Options include

     '"absolute tolerance"'
          Absolute tolerance.  May be either vector or scalar.  If a vector, it must match the dimension of the state vector, and the relative tolerance must also be a vector of the same length.

     '"relative tolerance"'
          Relative tolerance.  May be either vector or scalar.  If a vector, it must match the dimension of the state vector, and the absolute tolerance must also be a vector of the same length.

          The local error test applied at each integration step is

                 abs (local error in x(i))
                      <= rtol(i) * abs (Y(i)) + atol(i)

     '"compute consistent initial condition"'
          Denoting the differential variables in the state vector by 'Y_d' and the algebraic variables by 'Y_a', 'ddaspk' can solve one of two initialization problems:

            1. Given Y_d, calculate Y_a and Y'_d

            2. Given Y', calculate Y.

          In either case, initial values for the given components are input, and initial guesses for the unknown components must also be provided as input.  Set this option to 1 to solve the first problem, or 2 to solve the second (the default is 0, so you must provide a set of initial conditions that are consistent).

          If this option is set to a nonzero value, you must also set the "algebraic variables" option to declare which variables in the problem are algebraic.

     '"use initial condition heuristics"'
          Set to a nonzero value to use the initial condition heuristics options described below.

     '"initial condition heuristics"'
          A vector of the following parameters that can be used to control the initial condition calculation.

          'MXNIT'
               Maximum number of Newton iterations (default is 5).

          'MXNJ'
               Maximum number of Jacobian evaluations (default is 6).

          'MXNH'
               Maximum number of values of the artificial stepsize parameter to be tried if the "compute consistent initial condition" option has been set to 1 (default is 5).

               Note that the maximum total number of Newton iterations allowed is 'MXNIT*MXNJ*MXNH' if the "compute consistent initial condition" option has been set to 1 and 'MXNIT*MXNJ' if it is set to 2.

          'LSOFF'
               Set to a nonzero value to disable the linesearch algorithm (default is 0).

          'STPTOL'
               Minimum scaled step in linesearch algorithm (default is eps^(2/3)).

          'EPINIT'
               Swing factor in the Newton iteration convergence test.  The test is applied to the residual vector, premultiplied by the approximate Jacobian.  For convergence, the weighted RMS norm of this vector (scaled by the error weights) must be less than 'EPINIT*EPCON', where 'EPCON' = 0.33 is the analogous test constant used in the time steps.  The default is 'EPINIT' = 0.01.

     '"print initial condition info"'
          Set this option to a nonzero value to display detailed information about the initial condition calculation (default is 0).

     '"exclude algebraic variables from error test"'
          Set to a nonzero value to exclude algebraic variables from the error test.  You must also set the "algebraic variables" option to declare which variables in the problem are algebraic (default is 0).

     '"algebraic variables"'
          A vector of the same length as the state vector.  A nonzero element indicates that the corresponding element of the state vector is an algebraic variable (i.e., its derivative does not appear explicitly in the equation set).

          This option is required by the "compute consistent initial condition" and "exclude algebraic variables from error test" options.

     '"enforce inequality constraints"'
          Set to one of the following values to enforce the inequality constraints specified by the "inequality constraint types" option (default is 0).

            1. To have constraint checking only in the initial condition calculation.

            2. To enforce constraint checking during the integration.

            3. To enforce both options 1 and 2.

     '"inequality constraint types"'
          A vector of the same length as the state specifying the type of inequality constraint.  Each element of the vector corresponds to an element of the state and should be assigned one of the following codes

          -2
               Less than zero.

          -1
               Less than or equal to zero.

          0
               Not constrained.

          1
               Greater than or equal to zero.

          2
               Greater than zero.

          This option only has an effect if the "enforce inequality constraints" option is nonzero.

     '"initial step size"'
          Differential-algebraic problems may occasionally suffer from severe scaling difficulties on the first step.  If you know a great deal about the scaling of your problem, you can help to alleviate this problem by specifying an initial stepsize (default is computed automatically).

     '"maximum order"'
          Restrict the maximum order of the solution method.  This option must be between 1 and 5, inclusive (default is 5).

     '"maximum step size"'
          Setting the maximum stepsize will avoid passing over very large regions (default is not specified).

 -- Built-in Function: [X, XDOT, ISTATE, MSG] = daspk (FCN, X_0, XDOT_0, T, T_CRIT)
     Solve the set of differential-algebraic equations

          0 = f (x, xdot, t)

     with

          x(t_0) = x_0, xdot(t_0) = xdot_0

     The solution is returned in the matrices X and XDOT, with each row in the result matrices corresponding to one of the elements in the vector T.  The first element of T should be t_0 and correspond to the initial state of the system X_0 and its derivative XDOT_0, so that the first row of the output X is X_0 and the first row of the output XDOT is XDOT_0.

     The first argument, FCN, is a string, inline, or function handle that names the function f to call to compute the vector of residuals for the set of equations.  It must have the form

          RES = f (X, XDOT, T)

     in which X, XDOT, and RES are vectors, and T is a scalar.

     If FCN is a two-element string array or a two-element cell array of strings, inline functions, or function handles, the first element names the function f described above, and the second element names a function to compute the modified Jacobian

                df       df
          jac = -- + c ------
                dx     d xdot

     The modified Jacobian function must have the form


          JAC = j (X, XDOT, T, C)


     The second and third arguments to 'daspk' specify the initial condition of the states and their derivatives, and the fourth argument specifies a vector of output times at which the solution is desired, including the time corresponding to the initial condition.

     The set of initial states and derivatives are not strictly required to be consistent.  If they are not consistent, you must use the 'daspk_options' function to provide additional information so that 'daspk' can compute a consistent starting point.

     The fifth argument is optional, and may be used to specify a set of times that the DAE solver should not integrate past.  It is useful for avoiding difficulties with singularities and points where there is a discontinuity in the derivative.

     After a successful computation, the value of ISTATE will be greater than zero (consistent with the Fortran version of DASPK).

     If the computation is not successful, the value of ISTATE will be less than zero and MSG will contain additional information.

     You can use the function 'daspk_options' to set optional parameters for 'daspk'.

     Query or set options for the function 'dasrt'.

     When called with no arguments, the names of all available options and their current values are displayed.

     Given one argument, return the value of the option OPT.

     When called with two arguments, 'dasrt_options' sets the option OPT to value VAL.

     Options include

     '"absolute tolerance"'
          Absolute tolerance.  May be either vector or scalar.  If a vector, it must match the dimension of the state vector, and the relative tolerance must also be a vector of the same length.

     '"relative tolerance"'
          Relative tolerance.  May be either vector or scalar.  If a vector, it must match the dimension of the state vector, and the absolute tolerance must also be a vector of the same length.

          The local error test applied at each integration step is

                 abs (local error in x(i)) <= ...
                     rtol(i) * abs (Y(i)) + atol(i)

     '"initial step size"'
          Differential-algebraic problems may occasionally suffer from severe scaling difficulties on the first step.  If you know a great deal about the scaling of your problem, you can help to alleviate this problem by specifying an initial stepsize.

     '"maximum order"'
          Restrict the maximum order of the solution method.  This option must be between 1 and 5, inclusive.

     '"maximum step size"'
          Setting the maximum stepsize will avoid passing over very large regions.

     '"step limit"'
          Maximum number of integration steps to attempt on a single call to the underlying Fortran code.

     Solve the set of differential-algebraic equations

          0 = f (x, xdot, t)

     with

          x(t_0) = x_0, xdot(t_0) = xdot_0

     with functional stopping criteria (root solving).

     The solution is returned in the matrices X and XDOT, with each row in the result matrices corresponding to one of the elements in the vector T_OUT.  The first element of T should be t_0 and correspond to the initial state of the system X_0 and its derivative XDOT_0, so that the first row of the output X is X_0 and the first row of the output XDOT is XDOT_0.

     The vector T provides an upper limit on the length of the integration.  If the stopping condition is met, the vector T_OUT will be shorter than T, and the final element of T_OUT will be the point at which the stopping condition was met, and may not correspond to any element of the vector T.

     The first argument, FCN, is a string, inline, or function handle that names the function f to call to compute the vector of residuals for the set of equations.  It must have the form

          RES = f (X, XDOT, T)

     in which X, XDOT, and RES are vectors, and T is a scalar.

     If FCN is a two-element string array or a two-element cell array of strings, inline functions, or function handles, the first element names the function f described above, and the second element names a function to compute the modified Jacobian

                df       df
          jac = -- + c ------
                dx     d xdot

     The modified Jacobian function must have the form


          JAC = j (X, XDOT, T, C)


     The optional second argument names a function that defines the constraint functions whose roots are desired during the integration.  This function must have the form

          G_OUT = g (X, T)

     and return a vector of the constraint function values.  If the value of any of the constraint functions changes sign, DASRT will attempt to stop the integration at the point of the sign change.

     If the name of the constraint function is omitted, 'dasrt' solves the same problem as 'daspk' or 'dassl'.

     Note that because of numerical errors in the constraint functions due to round-off and integration error, DASRT may return false roots, or return the same root at two or more nearly equal values of T.  If such false roots are suspected, the user should consider smaller error tolerances or higher precision in the evaluation of the constraint functions.

     If a root of some constraint function defines the end of the problem, the input to DASRT should nevertheless allow integration to a point slightly past that root, so that DASRT can locate the root by interpolation.

     The third and fourth arguments to 'dasrt' specify the initial condition of the states and their derivatives, and the fourth argument specifies a vector of output times at which the solution is desired, including the time corresponding to the initial condition.

     The set of initial states and derivatives are not strictly required to be consistent.  In practice, however, DASSL is not very good at determining a consistent set for you, so it is best if you ensure that the initial values result in the function evaluating to zero.

     The sixth argument is optional, and may be used to specify a set of times that the DAE solver should not integrate past.  It is useful for avoiding difficulties with singularities and points where there is a discontinuity in the derivative.

     After a successful computation, the value of ISTATE will be greater than zero (consistent with the Fortran version of DASSL).

     If the computation is not successful, the value of ISTATE will be less than zero and MSG will contain additional information.

     You can use the function 'dasrt_options' to set optional parameters for 'dasrt'.

     '"compute consistent initial condition"'
          If nonzero, 'dassl' will attempt to compute a consistent set of initial conditions.  This is generally not reliable, so it is best to provide a consistent set and leave this option set to zero.

     '"enforce nonnegativity constraints"'
          If you know that the solutions to your equations will always be non-negative, it may help to set this parameter to a nonzero value.  However, it is probably best to try leaving this option set to zero first, and only setting it to a nonzero value if that doesn't work very well.

     Return a diagonal matrix with vector V on diagonal K.

     The second argument is optional.  If it is positive, the vector is placed on the K-th superdiagonal.  If it is negative, it is placed on the -K-th subdiagonal.  The default value of K is 0, and the vector is placed on the main diagonal.  For example:

          diag ([1, 2, 3], 1)

     If DIM is omitted, it defaults to the first non-singleton dimension.

     The optional "type" input determines the class of the variable used for calculations.  If the argument "native" is given, then the operation is performed in the same type as the original argument, rather than the default double type.

     For example:

             => 1
          prod ([true, true], "native")
             => true

     Alternatively, we can concatenate A and B along the second dimension in the following way:

          [A, B]

     DIM can be larger than the dimensions of the N-D array objects and the result will thus have DIM dimensions as the following example shows:

 -- Built-in Function: permute (A, PERM)
     Return the generalized transpose for an N-D array object A.

     The permutation vector PERM must contain the elements '1:ndims (A)' (in any order, but each element must appear only once).  The Nth dimension of A gets remapped to dimension 'PERM(N)'.  For example:

          X = zeros ([2, 3, 5, 7]);
          size (X)
             =>  2   3   5   7

          size (permute (X, [2, 1, 3, 4]))
             =>  3   2   5   7

          size (permute (X, [1, 3, 4, 2]))
             =>  2   5   7   3

          ## The identity permutation
          size (permute (X, [1, 2, 3, 4]))

 -- Built-in Function: length (A)
     Return the length of the object A.

     The length is 0 for empty objects, 1 for scalars, and the number of elements for vectors.  For matrix or N-dimensional objects, the length is the number of elements along the largest dimension (equivalent to 'max (size (A))').

 -- Built-in Function: numel (A)
 -- Built-in Function: numel (A, IDX1, IDX2, ...)
     Return the number of elements in the object A.

     Optionally, if indices IDX1, IDX2, ... are supplied, return the number of elements that would result from the indexing

          A(IDX1, IDX2, ...)

     Note that the indices do not have to be scalar numbers.  For example,

          A = 1;
          B = ones (2, 3);
          numel (A, B)

     will return 6, as this is the number of ways to index with B.  Or the index could be the string ":" which represents the colon operator.  For example,

          A = ones (5, 3);
          numel (A, 2, ":")

     will return 3 as the second row has three column entries.

     This method is also called when an object appears as lvalue with cs-list indexing, i.e., 'object{...}' or 'object(...).field'.

 -- Built-in Function: size (A)
 -- Built-in Function: size (A, DIM)
     Return the number of rows and columns of A.

     With one input argument and one output argument, the result is returned in a row vector.  If there are multiple output arguments, the number of rows is assigned to the first, and the number of columns to the second, etc.  For example:

          size ([1, 2; 3, 4; 5, 6])
             => [ 3, 2 ]

          [nr, nc] = size ([1, 2; 3, 4; 5, 6])
              => nr = 3
              => nc = 2

     If given a second argument, 'size' will return the size of the corresponding dimension.  For example,

          size ([1, 2; 3, 4; 5, 6], 2)
              => 2

     returns the number of columns in the given matrix.

 -- Built-in Function: sum (X, DIM)
 -- Built-in Function: sum (..., "native")
 -- Built-in Function: sum (..., "double")
 -- Built-in Function: sum (..., "extra")
     Sum of elements along dimension DIM.

     If DIM is omitted, it defaults to the first non-singleton dimension.

     The optional "type" input determines the class of the variable used for calculations.  If the argument "native" is given, then the operation is performed in the same type as the original argument, rather than the default double type.

     For example:

          sum ([true, true])
             => 2
          sum ([true, true], "native")
             => true

     On the contrary, if "double" is given, the sum is performed in double precision even for single precision inputs.

     For double precision inputs, the "extra" option will use a more accurate algorithm than straightforward summation.  For single precision inputs, "extra" is the same as "double".  Otherwise, "extra" has no effect.

 -- Built-in Function: sumsq (X, DIM)
     Sum of squares of elements along dimension DIM.

     If DIM is omitted, it defaults to the first non-singleton dimension.

     This function is conceptually equivalent to computing

          sum (x .* conj (x), dim)

     but it uses less memory and avoids calling 'conj' if X is real.

     Return a scalar, matrix, or N-dimensional array whose elements are all equal to the IEEE symbol NaN (Not a Number).

     NaN is the result of operations which do not produce a well defined numerical result.  Common operations which produce a NaN are arithmetic with infinity (Inf - Inf), zero divided by zero (0/0), and any operation involving another NaN value (5 + NaN).

     Note that NaN always compares not equal to NaN (NaN != NaN). This behavior is specified by the IEEE standard for floating point arithmetic.  To find NaN values, use the 'isnan' function.

     When called with no arguments, return a scalar with the value 'NaN'.

     When called with a single argument, return a square matrix with the dimension specified.

     Return an identity matrix.

     If invoked with a single scalar argument N, return a square NxN identity matrix.

     If supplied two scalar arguments (M, N), 'eye' takes them to be the number of rows and columns.  If given a vector with two elements, 'eye' uses the values of the elements as the number of rows and columns, respectively.  For example:

          eye (3)
           =>  1  0  0
               0  1  0
               0  0  1

     The following expressions all produce the same result:

          eye (2)
          ==
          eye (2, 2)
          ==
          eye (size ([1, 2; 3, 4]))

     The optional argument CLASS, allows 'eye' to return an array of the specified type, like

          val = zeros (n,m, "uint8")

     Calling 'eye' with no arguments is equivalent to calling it with an argument of 1.  Any negative dimensions are treated as zero.  These odd definitions are for compatibility with MATLAB.

     Return a row vector with N linearly spaced elements between BASE and LIMIT.

     If the number of elements is greater than one, then the endpoints BASE and LIMIT are always included in the range.  If BASE is greater than LIMIT, the elements are stored in decreasing order.  If the number of points is not specified, a value of 100 is used.

     The 'linspace' function always returns a row vector if both BASE and LIMIT are scalars.  If one, or both, of them are column vectors, 'linspace' returns a matrix.

     For compatibility with MATLAB, return the second argument (LIMIT) if fewer than two values are requested.

 -- Built-in Function: resize (X, M)

     Resize X cutting off elements as necessary.

     In the result, element with certain indices is equal to the corresponding element of X if the indices are within the bounds of X; otherwise, the element is set to zero.

     In other words, the statement

          y = resize (x, dv)

     is equivalent to the following code:

          y = zeros (dv, class (x));
          sz = min (dv, size (x));
          for i = 1:length (sz)
            idx{i} = 1:sz(i);
          endfor
          y(idx{:}) = x(idx{:});

     but is performed more efficiently.

     If only M is supplied, and it is a scalar, the dimension of the result is M-by-M.  If M, N, ... are all scalars, then the dimensions of the result are M-by-N-by-....  If given a vector as input, then the dimensions of the result are given by the elements of that vector.

     An object can be resized to more dimensions than it has; in such case the missing dimensions are assumed to be 1.  Resizing an object to fewer dimensions is not possible.

     Return a matrix with the specified dimensions (M, N, ...) whose elements are taken from the matrix A.

     The elements of the matrix are accessed in column-major order (like Fortran arrays are stored).

     The following code demonstrates reshaping a 1x4 row vector into a 2x2 square matrix.

          reshape ([1, 2, 3, 4], 2, 2)
                =>  1  3
                    2  4

     Note that the total number of elements in the original matrix ('prod (size (A))') must match the total number of elements in the new matrix ('prod ([M N ...])').

     A single dimension of the return matrix may be left unspecified and Octave will determine its size automatically.  An empty matrix ([]) is used to flag the unspecified dimension.

     Compute the p-norm of the matrix A.

     If the second argument is missing, 'p = 2' is assumed.

     If A is a matrix (or sparse matrix):

     P = '1'
          1-norm, the largest column sum of the absolute values of A.

     P = '2'
          Largest singular value of A.

     P = 'Inf' or "inf"
          Infinity norm, the largest row sum of the absolute values of A.

     P = "fro"

     other P, 'P > 1'
          maximum 'norm (A*x, p)' such that 'norm (x, p) == 1'

     If A is a vector or a scalar:

     P = 'Inf' or "inf"
          'max (abs (A))'.

     P = '-Inf'
          'min (abs (A))'.

     P = "fro"
          Frobenius norm of A, 'sqrt (sumsq (abs (A)))'.

     P = 0
          Hamming norm - the number of nonzero elements.

     other P, 'P > 1'
          p-norm of A, '(sum (abs (A) .^ P)) ^ (1/P)'.

     other P 'P < 1'
          the p-pseudonorm defined as above.

     If OPT is the value "rows", treat each row as a vector and compute its norm.  The result is returned as a column vector.  Similarly, if OPT is "columns" or "cols" then compute the norms of each column and return a row vector.

     Set or check a wall-clock timer.

     Calling 'tic' without an output argument sets the internal timer state.  Subsequent calls to 'toc' return the number of seconds since the timer was set.  For example,

          tic ();
          # many computations later...
          elapsed_time = toc ();

     will set the variable 'elapsed_time' to the number of seconds since the most recent call to the function 'tic'.

     If called with one output argument, 'tic' returns a scalar of type 'uint64' that may be later passed to 'toc'.

          id = tic; sleep (5); toc (id)
                => 5.0010

     Calling 'tic' and 'toc' this way allows nested timing calls.

     If you are more interested in the CPU time that your process used, you should use the 'cputime' function instead.  The 'tic' and 'toc' functions report the actual wall clock time that elapsed between the calls.  This may include time spent processing other jobs or doing nothing at all.

     See also: toc, cputime.

     Return the CPU time used by your Octave session.

     The first output is the total time spent executing your process and is equal to the sum of second and third outputs, which are the number of CPU seconds spent executing in user mode and the number of CPU seconds spent executing in system mode, respectively.

     If your system does not have a way to report CPU time usage, 'cputime' returns 0 for each of its output values.

     Note that because Octave used some CPU time to start, it is reasonable to check to see if 'cputime' works by checking to see if the total CPU time used is nonzero.

 -- Built-in Function: [S, I] = sort (X, DIM)
 -- Built-in Function: [S, I] = sort (X, MODE)
 -- Built-in Function: [S, I] = sort (X, DIM, MODE)
     Return a copy of X with the elements arranged in increasing order.

     For matrices, 'sort' orders the elements within columns

     For example:

          sort ([1, 2; 2, 3; 3, 1])
             =>  1  1
                 2  2
                 3  3

     If the optional argument DIM is given, then the matrix is sorted along the dimension defined by DIM.  The optional argument 'mode' defines the order in which the values will be sorted.  Valid values of 'mode' are "ascend" or "descend".

     The 'sort' function may also be used to produce a matrix containing the original row indices of the elements in the sorted matrix.  For example:

          [s, i] = sort ([1, 2; 2, 3; 3, 1])
            => s = 1  1
                   2  2
                   3  3
            => i = 1  3
                   2  1
                   3  2

     For equal elements, the indices are such that equal elements are listed in the order in which they appeared in the original list.

     Sorting of complex entries is done first by magnitude ('abs (Z)') and for any ties by phase angle ('angle (z)').  For example:

          sort ([1+i; 1; 1-i])
              => 1 + 0i
                 1 - 1i
                 1 + 1i

     NaN values are treated as being greater than any other value and are sorted to the end of the list.

     The 'sort' function may also be used to sort strings and cell arrays of strings, in which case ASCII dictionary order (uppercase 'A' precedes lowercase 'a') of the strings is used.

     The algorithm used in 'sort' is optimized for the sorting of partially ordered lists.

 -- Built-in Function: issorted (A)
 -- Built-in Function: issorted (A, MODE)
 -- Built-in Function: issorted (A, "rows", MODE)
     Return true if the array is sorted according to MODE, which may be either "ascending", "descending", or "either".

     By default, MODE is "ascending".  NaNs are treated in the same manner as 'sort'.

     If the optional argument "rows" is supplied, check whether the array is sorted by rows as output by the function 'sortrows' (with no options).

     This function does not support sparse matrices.

     See also: sort, sortrows.

 -- Built-in Function: nth_element (X, N)
 -- Built-in Function: nth_element (X, N, DIM)
     Select the n-th smallest element of a vector, using the ordering defined by 'sort'.

     The result is equivalent to 'sort(X)(N)'.

     N can also be a contiguous range, either ascending 'l:u' or descending 'u:-1:l', in which case a range of elements is returned.

     If X is an array, 'nth_element' operates along the dimension defined by DIM, or the first non-singleton dimension if DIM is not given.

     Programming Note: nth_element encapsulates the C++ standard library algorithms nth_element and partial_sort.  On average, the complexity of the operation is O(M*log(K)), where 'M = size (X, DIM)' and 'K = length (N)'.  This function is intended for cases where the ratio K/M is small; otherwise, it may be better to use 'sort'.

 -- Built-in Function: merge (MASK, TVAL, FVAL)
 -- Built-in Function: ifelse (MASK, TVAL, FVAL)
     Merge elements of TRUE_VAL and FALSE_VAL, depending on the value of MASK.

     If MASK is a logical scalar, the other two arguments can be arbitrary values.  Otherwise, MASK must be a logical array, and TVAL, FVAL should be arrays of matching class, or cell arrays.  In the scalar mask case, TVAL is returned if MASK is true, otherwise FVAL is returned.

     In the array mask case, both TVAL and FVAL must be either scalars or arrays with dimensions equal to MASK.  The result is constructed as follows:

          result(mask) = tval(mask);
          result(! mask) = fval(! mask);

     MASK can also be arbitrary numeric type, in which case it is first converted to logical.

 -- Built-in Function: diff (X)

 -- Built-in Function: diff (X, K, DIM)
     If X is a vector of length n, 'diff (X)' is the vector of first differences X(2) - X(1), ..., X(n) - X(n-1).

     If X is a matrix, 'diff (X)' is the matrix of column differences along the first non-singleton dimension.

     The second argument is optional.  If supplied, 'diff (X, K)', where K is a non-negative integer, returns the K-th differences.  It is possible that K is larger than the first non-singleton dimension of the matrix.  In this case, 'diff' continues to take the differences along the next non-singleton dimension.

     The dimension along which to take the difference can be explicitly stated with the optional variable DIM.  In this case the K-th order differences are calculated along this dimension.  In the case where K exceeds 'size (X, DIM)' an empty matrix is returned.

# name: <cell-element>

 -- Built-in Function: repelems (X, R)
     Construct a vector of repeated elements from X.

     R is a 2xN integer matrix specifying which elements to repeat and how often to repeat each element.  Entries in the first row, R(1,j), select an element to repeat.  The corresponding entry in the second row, R(2,j), specifies the repeat count.  If X is a matrix then the columns of X are imagined to be stacked on top of each other for purposes of the selection index.  A row vector is always returned.

     Conceptually the result is calculated as follows:

          y = [];
          for i = 1:columns (R)
            y = [y, X(R(1,i)*ones(1, R(2,i)))];

     When called with no input or output arguments, print the list of all functions with breakpoints and the line numbers where those breakpoints are set.

     If a function name FUNC is specified then only report breakpoints for the named function.

     The optional return argument BRK_LIST is a struct array with the following fields.

     name
          The name of the function with a breakpoint.

     file
          The name of the m-file where the function code is located.

     line
          A line number, or vector of line numbers, with a breakpoint.

     Note: When 'dbstatus' is called from the debug prompt within a function, the list of breakpoints is automatically trimmed to the breakpoints in the current function.

 -- Built-in Function: glob (PATTERN)
     Given an array of pattern strings (as a char array or a cell array) in PATTERN, return a cell array of file names that match any of them, or an empty cell array if no patterns match.

     The pattern strings are interpreted as filename globbing patterns (as they are used by Unix shells).

     Within a pattern

     '*'
          matches any string, including the null string,

     '?'
          matches any single character, and

     '[...]'
          matches any of the enclosed characters.

     Tilde expansion is performed on each of the patterns before looking for matching file names.  For example:

          ls
             =>
                file1  file2  file3  myfile1 myfile1b
          glob ("*file1")

     Read the matrix DATA from a text file which uses the delimiter SEP between data values.

     If SEP is not defined the separator between fields is determined from the file itself.

     Given two scalar arguments R0 and C0, these define the starting row and column of the data to be read.  These values are indexed from zero, such that the first row corresponds to an index of zero.

     The RANGE parameter may be a 4-element vector containing the upper left and lower right corner '[R0,C0,R1,C1]' where the lowest index value is zero.  Alternatively, a spreadsheet style range such as "A2..Q15" or "T1:AA5" can be used.  The lowest alphabetical index 'A' refers to the first column.  The lowest row index is 1.

     FILE should be a file name or file id given by 'fopen'.  In the latter case, the file is read until end of file is reached.

     The "emptyvalue" option may be used to specify the value used to fill empty fields.  The default is zero.

 -- Built-in Function: dot (X, Y, DIM)
     Compute the dot product of two vectors.

     If X and Y are matrices, calculate the dot products along the first non-singleton dimension.

     If the optional argument DIM is given, calculate the dot products along this dimension.

     This is equivalent to 'sum (conj (X) .* Y, DIM)', but avoids forming a temporary array and is faster.  When X and Y are column vectors, the result is equivalent to 'X' * Y'.

 -- Built-in Function: [SN, CN, DN, ERR] = ellipj (U, M)
 -- Built-in Function: [SN, CN, DN, ERR] = ellipj (U, M, TOL)
     Compute the Jacobi elliptic functions SN, CN, and DN of complex argument U and real parameter M.

     If M is a scalar, the results are the same size as U.  If U is a scalar, the results are the same size as M.  If U is a column vector and M is a row vector, the results are matrices with 'length (U)' rows and 'length (M)' columns.  Otherwise, U and M must conform in size and the results will be the same size as the inputs.

     The value of U may be complex.  The value of M must be 0 <= M <= 1.

     The optional input TOL is currently ignored (MATLAB uses this to allow faster, less accurate approximation).

     If requested, ERR contains the following status information and is the same size as the result.

       0. Normal return.

       1. Error--no computation, algorithm termination condition not met, return 'NaN'.

 -- Built-in Function: error (TEMPLATE, ...)
 -- Built-in Function: error (ID, TEMPLATE, ...)
     Display an error message and stop m-file execution.

     Format the optional arguments under the control of the template string TEMPLATE using the same rules as the 'printf' family of functions (*note Formatted Output::) and print the resulting message on the 'stderr' stream.  The message is prefixed by the character string 'error: '.

     Calling 'error' also sets Octave's internal error state such that control will return to the top level without evaluating any further commands.  This is useful for aborting from functions or scripts.

     If the error message does not end with a newline character, Octave will print a traceback of all the function calls leading to the error.  For example, given the following function definitions:

          function f () g (); end
          function g () h (); end
          function h () nargin == 1 || error ("nargin != 1"); end

     calling the function 'f' will result in a list of messages that can help you to quickly locate the exact location of the error:

          f ()
          error: nargin != 1
          error: called from:
          error:   error at line -1, column -1
          error:   h at line 1, column 27
          error:   g at line 1, column 15
          error:   f at line 1, column 15

     If the error message ends in a newline character, Octave will print the message but will not display any traceback messages as it returns control to the top level.  For example, modifying the error message in the previous example to end in a newline causes Octave to only print a single message:

          function h () nargin == 1 || error ("nargin != 1\n"); end
          f ()
          error: nargin != 1

     A null string ("") input to 'error' will be ignored and the code will continue running as if the statement were a NOP.  This is for compatibility with MATLAB.  It also makes it possible to write code such as

          err_msg = "";
          if (CONDITION 1)
            err_msg = "CONDITION 1 found";
          elseif (CONDITION2)
            err_msg = "CONDITION 2 found";
          ...
          endif
          error (err_msg);

     which will only stop execution if an error has been found.

     Implementation Note: For compatibility with MATLAB, escape sequences in TEMPLATE (e.g., "\n" => newline) are processed regardless of whether TEMPLATE has been defined with single quotes, as long as there are two or more input arguments.  To disable escape sequence expansion use a second backslash before the sequence (e.g., "\\n") or use the 'regexptranslate' function.

 -- Built-in Function: warning (STATE, ID, "local")
     Display a warning message or control the behavior of Octave's warning system.

     Format the optional arguments under the control of the template string TEMPLATE using the same rules as the 'printf' family of functions (*note Formatted Output::) and print the resulting message on the 'stderr' stream.  The message is prefixed by the character string 'warning: '.  You should use this function when you want to notify the user of an unusual condition, but only when it makes sense for your program to go on.

     The optional message identifier allows users to enable or disable warnings tagged by ID.  A message identifier is of the form "NAMESPACE:WARNING-NAME". Octave's own warnings use the "Octave" namespace (*note XREFwarning_ids::).  The special identifier "all" may be used to set the state of all warnings.

     If the first argument is "on" or "off", set the state of a particular warning using the identifier ID.  If the first argument is "query", query the state of this warning instead.  If the identifier is omitted, a value of "all" is assumed.  If you set the state of a warning to "error", the warning named by ID is handled as if it were an error instead.  So, for example, the following handles all warnings as errors:

          warning ("error");

     If the state is "on" or "off" and the third argument is "backtrace", then a stack trace is printed along with the warning message when warnings occur inside function calls.  This option is enabled by default.

     If the state is "on", "off", or "error" and the third argument is "local", then the warning state will be set temporarily, until the end of the current function.  Changes to warning states that are set locally affect the current function and all functions called from the current scope.  The previous warning state is restored on return from the current function.  The "local" option is ignored if used in the top-level workspace.

     Implementation Note: For compatibility with MATLAB, escape sequences in TEMPLATE (e.g., "\n" => newline) are processed regardless of whether TEMPLATE has been defined with single quotes, as long as there are two or more input arguments.  To disable escape sequence expansion use a second backslash before the sequence (e.g., "\\n") or use the 'regexptranslate' function.

     If called with two arguments, N is expected to be an integer specifying the number of elements of X to use, or an empty matrix to specify that its value should be ignored.  If N is larger than the dimension along which the FFT is calculated, then X is resized and padded with zeros.  Otherwise, if N is smaller than the dimension along which the FFT is calculated, then X is truncated.

 -- Built-in Function: STR = fgetl (FID)
 -- Built-in Function: STR = fgetl (FID, LEN)
     Read characters from a file, stopping after a newline, or EOF, or LEN characters have been read.

     The characters read, excluding the possible trailing newline, are returned as a string.

     If LEN is omitted, 'fgetl' reads until the next newline character.

     If there are no more characters to read, 'fgetl' returns -1.

     To read a line and return the terminating newline see 'fgets'.

 -- Built-in Function: NLINES = fskipl (FID)
 -- Built-in Function: NLINES = fskipl (FID, COUNT)
 -- Built-in Function: NLINES = fskipl (FID, Inf)
     Read and skip COUNT lines from the file specified by the file descriptor FID.

     'fskipl' discards characters until an end-of-line is encountered exactly COUNT-times, or until the end-of-file marker is found.

     If COUNT is omitted, it defaults to 1.  COUNT may also be 'Inf', in which case lines are skipped until the end of the file.  This form is suitable for counting the number of lines in a file.

     Returns the number of lines skipped (end-of-line sequences encountered).

 -- Built-in Function: [FID, MSG] = fopen (...)
 -- Built-in Function: FID_LIST = fopen ("all")
 -- Built-in Function: [FILE, MODE, ARCH] = fopen (FID)
     Open a file for low-level I/O or query open files and file descriptors.

     The first form of the 'fopen' function opens the named file with the specified mode (read-write, read-only, etc.)  and architecture interpretation (IEEE big endian, IEEE little endian, etc.), and returns an integer value that may be used to refer to the file later.  If an error occurs, FID is set to -1 and MSG contains the corresponding system error message.  The MODE is a one or two character string that specifies whether the file is to be opened for reading, writing, or both.

     The second form of the 'fopen' function returns a vector of file ids corresponding to all the currently open files, excluding the 'stdin', 'stdout', and 'stderr' streams.

     The third form of the 'fopen' function returns information about the open file given its file id.

     For example,

          myfile = fopen ("splat.dat", "r", "ieee-le");

     opens the file 'splat.dat' for reading.  If necessary, binary numeric values will be read assuming they are stored in IEEE format with the least significant bit first, and then converted to the native representation.

     Opening a file that is already open simply opens it again and returns a separate file id.  It is not an error to open a file several times, though writing to the same file through several different file ids may produce unexpected results.

     The possible values 'mode' may have are

     'r' (default)
          Open a file for reading.

     'w'
          Open a file for writing.  The previous contents are discarded.

     'a'
          Open or create a file for writing at the end of the file.

     'r+'
          Open an existing file for reading and writing.

     'w+'
          Open a file for reading or writing.  The previous contents are discarded.

     'a+'
          Open or create a file for reading or writing at the end of the file.

     Append a "t" to the mode string to open the file in text mode or a "b" to open in binary mode.  On Windows and Macintosh systems, text mode reading and writing automatically converts linefeeds to the appropriate line end character for the system (carriage-return linefeed on Windows, carriage-return on Macintosh).  The default when no mode is specified is binary mode.

     Additionally, you may append a "z" to the mode string to open a gzipped file for reading or writing.  For this to be successful, you must also open the file in binary mode.

     The parameter ARCH is a string specifying the default data format for the file.  Valid values for ARCH are:

     "native" or "n" (default)
          The format of the current machine.

     "ieee-be" or "b"
          IEEE big endian format.

     "ieee-le" or "l"
          IEEE little endian format.

     However, conversions are currently only supported for 'native', 'ieee-be', and 'ieee-le' formats.

     When opening a new file that does not yet exist, permissions will be set to '0666 - UMASK'.

     Set the file pointer to the location OFFSET within the file FID.

     The pointer is positioned OFFSET characters from the ORIGIN, which may be one of the predefined variables 'SEEK_CUR' (current position), 'SEEK_SET' (beginning), or 'SEEK_END' (end of file) or strings "cof", "bof" or "eof".  If ORIGIN is omitted, 'SEEK_SET' is assumed.  OFFSET may be positive, negative, or zero but not all combinations of ORIGIN and OFFSET can be realized.

     In the first form, read from FID according to TEMPLATE, returning the result in the matrix VAL.

     The optional argument SIZE specifies the amount of data to read and may be one of

     'Inf'
          Read as much as possible, returning a column vector.

     'NR'
          Read up to NR elements, returning a column vector.

     '[NR, Inf]'
          Read as much as possible, returning a matrix with NR rows.  If the number of elements read is not an exact multiple of NR, the last column is padded with zeros.

     '[NR, NC]'
          Read up to 'NR * NC' elements, returning a matrix with NR rows.  If the number of elements read is not an exact multiple of NR, the last column is padded with zeros.

     If SIZE is omitted, a value of 'Inf' is assumed.

     A string is returned if TEMPLATE specifies only character conversions.

     The number of items successfully read is returned in COUNT.

     If an error occurs, ERRMSG contains a system-dependent error message.

     In the second form, read from FID according to TEMPLATE, with each conversion specifier in TEMPLATE corresponding to a single scalar return value.  This form is more "C-like", and also compatible with previous versions of Octave.  The number of successful conversions is returned in COUNT

     Read binary data from the file specified by the file descriptor FID.

     The optional argument SIZE specifies the amount of data to read and may be one of

     'Inf'
          Read as much as possible, returning a column vector.

     'NR'
          Read up to NR elements, returning a column vector.

     '[NR, Inf]'
          Read as much as possible, returning a matrix with NR rows.  If the number of elements read is not an exact multiple of NR, the last column is padded with zeros.

     '[NR, NC]'
          Read up to 'NR * NC' elements, returning a matrix with NR rows.  If the number of elements read is not an exact multiple of NR, the last column is padded with zeros.

     If SIZE is omitted, a value of 'Inf' is assumed.

     The optional argument PRECISION is a string specifying the type of data to read and may be one of

     "schar"
     "signed char"
          Signed character.

     "uchar"
     "unsigned char"
          Unsigned character.

     "int8"
     "integer*1"

          8-bit signed integer.

     "int16"
     "integer*2"
          16-bit signed integer.

     "int32"
     "integer*4"
          32-bit signed integer.

     "int64"
     "integer*8"
          64-bit signed integer.

     "uint8"
          8-bit unsigned integer.

     "uint16"
          16-bit unsigned integer.

     "uint32"
          32-bit unsigned integer.

     "uint64"
          64-bit unsigned integer.

     "single"
     "float32"
     "real*4"
          32-bit floating point number.

     "double"
     "float64"
     "real*8"
          64-bit floating point number.

     "char"
     "char*1"
          Single character.

     "short"
          Short integer (size is platform dependent).

     "int"
          Integer (size is platform dependent).

     "long"
          Long integer (size is platform dependent).

     "ushort"
     "unsigned short"
          Unsigned short integer (size is platform dependent).

     "uint"
     "unsigned int"
          Unsigned integer (size is platform dependent).

     "ulong"
     "unsigned long"
          Unsigned long integer (size is platform dependent).

     "float"
          Single precision floating point number (size is platform dependent).

     The default precision is "uchar".

     The PRECISION argument may also specify an optional repeat count.  For example, '32*single' causes 'fread' to read a block of 32 single precision floating point numbers.  Reading in blocks is useful in combination with the SKIP argument.

     The PRECISION argument may also specify a type conversion.  For example, 'int16=>int32' causes 'fread' to read 16-bit integer values and return an array of 32-bit integer values.  By default, 'fread' returns a double precision array.  The special form '*TYPE' is shorthand for 'TYPE=>TYPE'.

     The conversion and repeat counts may be combined.  For example, the specification '32*single=>single' causes 'fread' to read blocks of single precision floating point values and return an array of single precision values instead of the default array of double precision values.

     The optional argument SKIP specifies the number of bytes to skip after each element (or block of elements) is read.  If it is not specified, a value of 0 is assumed.  If the final block read is not complete, the final skip is omitted.  For example,

          fread (f, 10, "3*single=>single", 8)

     will omit the final 8-byte skip because the last read will not be a complete block of 3 values.

     The optional argument ARCH is a string specifying the data format for the file.  Valid values are

     "native" or "n"
          The format of the current machine.

     "ieee-be" or "b"
          IEEE big endian.

     "ieee-le" or "l"
          IEEE little endian.

     If no ARCH is given the value used in the call to 'fopen' which created the file descriptor is used.  Otherwise, the value specified with 'fread' overrides that of 'fopen' and determines the data format.

     The output argument VAL contains the data read from the file.

     The optional return value COUNT contains the number of elements read.

 -- Built-in Function: MSG = ferror (FID)
 -- Built-in Function: [MSG, ERR] = ferror (FID)
 -- Built-in Function: [DOTS] = ferror (FID, "clear")
     Query the error status of the stream specified by file descriptor FID

     If an error condition exists then return a string MSG describing the error.  Otherwise, return an empty string "".

     The second input "clear" is optional.  If supplied, the error state on the stream will be cleared.

     The optional second output is a numeric indication of the error status.  ERR is 1 if an error condition has been encountered and 0 otherwise.

     Note that 'ferror' indicates if an error has already occurred, not whether the next operation will result in an error condition.

 -- Built-in Function: FID = popen (COMMAND, MODE)
     Start a process and create a pipe.

     The name of the command to run is given by COMMAND.  The argument MODE may be

     '"r"'
          The pipe will be connected to the standard output of the process, and open for reading.

     '"w"'
          The pipe will be connected to the standard input of the process, and open for writing.

     The file identifier corresponding to the input or output stream of the process is returned in FID.

     For example:

          fid = popen ("ls -ltr / | tail -3", "r");
          while (ischar (s = fgets (fid)))
            fputs (stdout, s);

 -- Built-in Function: FNAME = tempname (DIR, PREFIX)
     Return a unique temporary file name as a string.

     If PREFIX is omitted, a value of "oct-" is used.

     If DIR is also omitted, the default directory for temporary files ('P_tmpdir') is used.  If DIR is provided, it must exist, otherwise the default directory for temporary files is used.

     Programming Note: Because the named file is not opened by 'tempname', it is possible, though relatively unlikely, that it will not be available by the time your program attempts to open it.  If this is a concern, see 'tmpfile'.

     Return the file ID corresponding to a new temporary file with a unique name.

     The file is opened in binary read/write ("w+b") mode and will be deleted automatically when it is closed or when Octave exits.

     If successful, FID is a valid file ID and MSG is an empty string.  Otherwise, FID is -1 and MSG contains a system-dependent error message.

 -- Built-in Function: [FID, NAME, MSG] = mkstemp ("TEMPLATE", DELETE)
     Return the file descriptor FID corresponding to a new temporary file with a unique name created from TEMPLATE.

     The last six characters of TEMPLATE must be "XXXXXX" and these are replaced with a string that makes the filename unique.  The file is then created with mode read/write and permissions that are system dependent (on GNU/Linux systems, the permissions will be 0600 for versions of glibc 2.0.7 and later).  The file is opened in binary mode and with the 'O_EXCL' flag.

     If the optional argument DELETE is supplied and is true, the file will be deleted automatically when Octave exits.

     If successful, FID is a valid file ID, NAME is the name of the file, and MSG is an empty string.  Otherwise, FID is -1, NAME is empty, and MSG contains a system-dependent error message.

 -- Built-in Function: umask (MASK)
     Set the permission mask for file creation.

     The parameter MASK is an integer, interpreted as an octal number.

     If successful, returns the previous value of the mask (as an integer to be interpreted as an octal number); otherwise an error message is printed.

     The permission mask is a UNIX concept used when creating new objects on a file system such as files, directories, or named FIFOs.  The object to be created has base permissions in an octal number MODE which are modified according to the octal value of MASK.  The final permissions for the new object are 'MODE - MASK'.

 -- Built-in Function: [Y, SF] = filter (B, A, X, [], DIM)
 -- Built-in Function: [Y, SF] = filter (B, A, X, SI, DIM)
     Apply a 1-D digital filter to the data X.

     'filter' returns the solution to the following linear, time-invariant difference equation:

           N                   M
          SUM a(k+1) y(n-k) = SUM b(k+1) x(n-k)    for 1<=n<=length(x)
          k=0                 k=0

     where N=length(a)-1 and M=length(b)-1.  The result is calculated over the first non-singleton dimension of X or over DIM if supplied.

     An equivalent form of the equation is:

                    N                   M
          y(n) = - SUM c(k+1) y(n-k) + SUM d(k+1) x(n-k)  for 1<=n<=length(x)
                   k=1                 k=0

     where c = a/a(1) and d = b/a(1).

     If the fourth argument SI is provided, it is taken as the initial state of the system and the final state is returned as SF.  The state vector is a column vector whose length is equal to the length of the longest coefficient vector minus one.  If SI is not supplied, the initial state vector is set to all zeros.

     In terms of the Z Transform, Y is the result of passing the discrete-time signal X through a system characterized by the following rational system function:

                    M
                   SUM d(k+1) z^(-k)
                   k=0

 -- Built-in Function: IDX = find (X)

 -- Built-in Function: IDX = find (X, N, DIRECTION)
 -- Built-in Function: [i, j] = find (...)
 -- Built-in Function: [i, j, v] = find (...)
     Return a vector of indices of nonzero elements of a matrix, as a row if X is a row vector or as a column otherwise.

     To obtain a single index for each matrix element, Octave pretends that the columns of a matrix form one long vector (like Fortran arrays are stored).  For example:

          find (eye (2))
            => [ 1; 4 ]

     If two inputs are given, N indicates the maximum number of elements to find from the beginning of the matrix or vector.

     If three inputs are given, DIRECTION should be one of "first" or "last", requesting only the first or last N indices, respectively.  However, the indices are always returned in ascending order.

     If two outputs are requested, 'find' returns the row and column indices of nonzero elements of a matrix.  For example:

          [i, j] = find (2 * eye (2))
              => i = [ 1; 2 ]
              => j = [ 1; 2 ]

     If three outputs are requested, 'find' also returns a vector containing the nonzero values.  For example:

          [i, j, v] = find (3 * eye (2))
                 => i = [ 1; 2 ]
                 => j = [ 1; 2 ]
                 => v = [ 3; 3 ]

     Note that this function is particularly useful for sparse matrices, as it extracts the nonzero elements as vectors, which can then be used to create the original matrix.  For example:

          sz = size (a);
          [i, j, v] = find (a);
          b = sparse (i, j, v, sz(1), sz(2));

 -- Mapping Function: gammainc (X, A)

 -- Mapping Function: gammainc (X, A, "upper")
     Compute the normalized incomplete gamma function.

     This is defined as

                                          x
                                 1       /
          gammainc (x, a) = ---------    | exp (-t) t^(a-1) dt
                            gamma (a)    /
                                      t=0

     with the limiting value of 1 as X approaches infinity.  The standard notation is P(a,x), e.g., Abramowitz and Stegun (6.5.1).

     If A is scalar, then 'gammainc (X, A)' is returned for each element of X and vice versa.

     If neither X nor A is scalar, the sizes of X and A must agree, and 'gammainc' is applied element-by-element.

     By default the incomplete gamma function integrated from 0 to X is computed.  If "upper" is given then the complementary function integrated from X to infinity is calculated.  It should be noted that

          gammainc (X, A) == 1 - gammainc (X, A, "upper")

 -- Built-in Function: G = gcd (A1, A2, ...)
 -- Built-in Function: [G, V1, ...] = gcd (A1, A2, ...)
     Compute the greatest common divisor of A1, A2, ....

     If more than one argument is given then all arguments must be the same size or scalar.  In this case the greatest common divisor is calculated for each element individually.  All elements must be ordinary or Gaussian (complex) integers.  Note that for Gaussian integers, the gcd is only unique up to a phase factor (multiplication by 1, -1, i, or -i), so an arbitrary greatest common divisor among the four possible is returned.

     Optional return arguments V1, ..., contain integer vectors such that,

          G = V1 .* A1 + V2 .* A2 + ...

     Example code:

          gcd ([15, 9], [20, 18])
             =>  5  9

 -- Built-in Function: set (H, PV)
 -- Built-in Function: VALUE_LIST = set (H, PROPERTY)
 -- Built-in Function: ALL_VALUE_LIST = set (H)
     Set named property values for the graphics handle (or vector of graphics handles) H.

     There are three ways to give the property names and values:

        * as a comma separated list of PROPERTY, VALUE pairs

          Here, each PROPERTY is a string containing the property name, each VALUE is a value of the appropriate type for the property.

        * as a cell array of strings PROPERTIES containing property names and a cell array VALUES containing property values.

          In this case, the number of columns of VALUES must match the number of elements in PROPERTIES.  The first column of VALUES contains values for the first entry in PROPERTIES, etc.  The number of rows of VALUES must be 1 or match the number of elements of H.  In the first case, each handle in H will be assigned the same values.  In the latter case, the first handle in H will be assigned the values from the first row of VALUES and so on.

        * as a structure array PV

          Here, the field names of PV represent the property names, and the field values give the property values.  In contrast to the previous case, all elements of PV will be set in all handles in H independent of the dimensions of PV.

     'set' is also used to query the list of values a named property will take.  'CLIST = set (H, "property")' will return the list of possible values for "property" in the cell list CLIST.  If no output variable is used then the list is formatted and printed to the screen.

     If no property is specified ('SLIST = set (H)') then a structure SLIST is returned where the fieldnames are the properties of the object H and the fields are the list of possible values for each property.  If no output variable is used then the list is formatted and printed to the screen.

     For example,

          hf = figure ();
          set (hf, "paperorientation")
          =>  paperorientation:  [ landscape | {portrait} | rotated ]

     shows the paperorientation property can take three values with the default being "portrait".

# type: sq_string
# elements: 1
# length: 1134
 -- Built-in Function: addlistener (H, PROP, FCN)
     Register FCN as listener for the property PROP of the graphics object H.

     Property listeners are executed (in order of registration) when the property is set.  The new value is already available when the listeners are executed.

     PROP must be a string naming a valid property in H.

     FCN can be a function handle, a string or a cell array whose first element is a function handle.  If FCN is a function handle, the corresponding function should accept at least 2 arguments, that will be set to the object handle and the empty matrix respectively.  If FCN is a string, it must be any valid octave expression.  If FCN is a cell array, the first element must be a function handle with the same signature as described above.  The next elements of the cell array are passed as additional arguments to the function.

     Example:

          function my_listener (h, dummy, p1)
            fprintf ("my_listener called with p1=%s\n", p1);
          endfunction

     The function FCN must be the same variable (not just the same value), as was passed to the original call to 'addlistener'.

     If FCN is not defined then all listener functions of PROP are removed.

     Example:

          function my_listener (h, dummy, p1)
            fprintf ("my_listener called with p1=%s\n", p1);
          endfunction

 -- Built-in Function: addproperty (NAME, H, TYPE)
 -- Built-in Function: addproperty (NAME, H, TYPE, ARG, ...)
     Create a new property named NAME in graphics object H.

     TYPE determines the type of the property to create.  ARGS usually contains the default value of the property, but additional arguments might be given, depending on the type of the property.

     The supported property types are:

     'string'
          A string property.  ARG contains the default string value.

     'any'
          An un-typed property.  This kind of property can hold any octave value.  ARGS contains the default value.

     'radio'
          A string property with a limited set of accepted values.  The first argument must be a string with all accepted values separated by a vertical bar ('|').  The default value can be marked by enclosing it with a '{' '}' pair.  The default value may also be given as an optional second string argument.

     'boolean'
          A boolean property.  This property type is equivalent to a radio property with "on|off" as accepted values.  ARG contains the default property value.

     'double'
          A scalar double property.  ARG contains the default value.

     'handle'
          A handle property.  This kind of property holds the handle of a graphics object.  ARG contains the default handle value.  When no default value is given, the property is initialized to the empty matrix.

     'data'
          A data (matrix) property.  ARG contains the default data value.  When no default value is given, the data is initialized to the empty matrix.

     'color'
          A color property.  ARG contains the default color value.  When no default color is given, the property is set to black.  An optional second string argument may be given to specify an additional set of accepted string values (like a radio property).

     TYPE may also be the concatenation of a core object type and a valid property name for that object type.  The property created then has the same characteristics as the referenced property (type, possible values, hidden state...).  This allows one to clone an existing property into the graphics object H.

     Examples:

          addproperty ("my_property", gcf, "string", "a string value");
          addproperty ("my_radio", gcf, "radio", "val_1|val_2|{val_3}");
          addproperty ("my_style", gcf, "linelinestyle", "--");

 -- Built-in Function: waitfor (H)
 -- Built-in Function: waitfor (H, PROP)
 -- Built-in Function: waitfor (H, PROP, VALUE)
 -- Built-in Function: waitfor (..., "timeout", TIMEOUT)
     Suspend the execution of the current program until a condition is satisfied on the graphics handle H.

     While the program is suspended graphics events are still processed normally, allowing callbacks to modify the state of graphics objects.  This function is reentrant and can be called from a callback, while another 'waitfor' call is pending at the top-level.

     In the first form, program execution is suspended until the graphics object H is destroyed.  If the graphics handle is invalid, the function returns immediately.

     In the second form, execution is suspended until the graphics object is destroyed or the property named PROP is modified.  If the graphics handle is invalid or the property does not exist, the function returns immediately.

     In the third form, execution is suspended until the graphics object is destroyed or the property named PROP is set to VALUE.  The function 'isequal' is used to compare property values.  If the graphics handle is invalid, the property does not exist or the property is already set to VALUE, the function returns immediately.

     An optional timeout can be specified using the property 'timeout'.  This timeout value is the number of seconds to wait for the condition to be true.  TIMEOUT must be at least 1.  If a smaller value is specified, a warning is issued and a value of 1 is used instead.  If the timeout value is not an integer, it is truncated towards 0.

     To define a condition on a property named 'timeout', use the string '\timeout' instead.

     In all cases, typing CTRL-C stops program execution immediately.

     Compute the Hessenberg decomposition of the matrix A.

     The Hessenberg decomposition is 'P * H * P' = A' where P is a square unitary matrix ('P' * P = I', using complex-conjugate transposition) and H is upper Hessenberg ('H(i, j) = 0 forall i > j+1)'.

     The Hessenberg decomposition is usually used as the first step in an eigenvalue computation, but has other applications as well (see Golub, Nash, and Van Loan, IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 1979).

 -- Built-in Function: N = hex2num (S)
 -- Built-in Function: N = hex2num (S, CLASS)
     Typecast the 16 character hexadecimal character string to an IEEE 754 double precision number.

     If fewer than 16 characters are given the strings are right padded with '0' characters.

     Given a string matrix, 'hex2num' treats each row as a separate number.

          hex2num (["4005bf0a8b145769"; "4024000000000000"])
             => [2.7183; 10.000]

     The optional argument CLASS can be passed as the string "single" to specify that the given string should be interpreted as a single precision number.  In this case, S should be an 8 character hexadecimal string.  For example:

          hex2num (["402df854"; "41200000"], "single")
             => [2.7183; 10.000]

 -- Built-in Function: S = num2hex (N)
     Typecast a double or single precision number or vector to a 8 or 16 character hexadecimal string of the IEEE 754 representation of the number.

     For example:

          num2hex ([-1, 1, e, Inf])
          => "bff0000000000000
              3ff0000000000000
              4005bf0a8b145769
              7ff0000000000000"

     If the argument N is a single precision number or vector, the returned string has a length of 8.  For example:

          num2hex (single ([-1, 1, e, Inf]))
          => "bf800000
              3f800000

 -- Built-in Function: ANS = input (PROMPT)
 -- Built-in Function: ANS = input (PROMPT, "s")
     Print PROMPT and wait for user input.

     For example,

          input ("Pick a number, any number! ")

     prints the prompt

          Pick a number, any number!

     and waits for the user to enter a value.  The string entered by the user is evaluated as an expression, so it may be a literal constant, a variable name, or any other valid Octave code.

     The number of return arguments, their size, and their class depend on the expression entered.

     If you are only interested in getting a literal string value, you can call 'input' with the character string "s" as the second argument.  This tells Octave to return the string entered by the user directly, without evaluating it first.

     Because there may be output waiting to be displayed by the pager, it is a good idea to always call 'fflush (stdout)' before calling 'input'.  This will ensure that all pending output is written to the screen before your prompt.

     Return logical true if the answer is yes or false if the answer is no.

     Takes one argument, PROMPT, which is the string to display when asking the question.  PROMPT should end in a space; 'yes-or-no' adds the string '(yes or no) ' to it.  The user must confirm the answer with <RET> and can edit it until it has been confirmed.

 -- Built-in Function: keyboard ()
 -- Built-in Function: keyboard ("PROMPT")
     Stop m-file execution and enter debug mode.

     When the 'keyboard' function is executed, Octave prints a prompt and waits for user input.  The input strings are then evaluated and the results are printed.  This makes it possible to examine the values of variables within a function, and to assign new values if necessary.  To leave the prompt and return to normal execution type 'return' or 'dbcont'.  The 'keyboard' function does not return an exit status.

     If 'keyboard' is invoked without arguments, a default prompt of 'debug> ' is used.

     Query or set the primary prompt string.

     When executing interactively, Octave displays the primary prompt when it is ready to read a command.

     The default value of the primary prompt string is "octave:\#> ".  To change it, use a command like

          PS1 ("\\u@\\H> ")

     which will result in the prompt 'boris@kremvax> ' for the user 'boris' logged in on the host 'kremvax.kgb.su'.  Note that two backslashes are required to enter a backslash into a double-quoted character string.  *Note Strings::.

     You can also use ANSI escape sequences if your terminal supports them.  This can be useful for coloring the prompt.  For example,

          PS1 ("\\[\\033[01;31m\\]\\s:\\#> \\[\\033[0m\\]")

     will give the default Octave prompt a red coloring.

     When called from inside a function with the "local" option, the variable is changed locally for the function and any subroutines it calls.  The original variable value is restored when exiting the function.

     Query or set the character used to separate the filename from the subfunction names contained within the file.

     By default this is the character '>'.  This can be used in a generic manner to interact with subfunctions.  For example,

          help (["myfunc", filemarker, "mysubfunc"])

     returns the help string associated with the subfunction 'mysubfunc' located in the file 'myfunc.m'.

     'filemarker' is also useful during debugging for placing breakpoints within subfunctions or nested functions.  For example,

          dbstop (["myfunc", filemarker, "mysubfunc"])

     will set a breakpoint at the first line of the subfunction 'mysubfunc'.

     Compute the inverse of the square matrix A.

     Return an estimate of the reciprocal condition number if requested, otherwise warn of an ill-conditioned matrix if the reciprocal condition number is small.

     In general it is best to avoid calculating the inverse of a matrix directly.  For example, it is both faster and more accurate to solve systems of equations (A*x = b) with 'Y = A \ b', rather than 'Y = inv (A) * b'.

     If called with a sparse matrix, then in general X will be a full matrix requiring significantly more storage.  Avoid forming the inverse of a sparse matrix if possible.

     Form the Kronecker product of two or more matrices.

     This is defined block by block as

          x = [ a(i,j)*b ]

     For example:

          kron (1:4, ones (3, 1))

                   1  2  3  4

     If there are more than two input arguments A1, A2, ..., AN the Kronecker product is computed as

          kron (kron (A1, A2), ..., AN)

     Since the Kronecker product is associative, this is well-defined.

 -- Built-in Function: path (...)
     Modify or display Octave's load path.

     If NARGIN and NARGOUT are zero, display the elements of Octave's load path in an easy to read format.

     If NARGIN is zero and nargout is greater than zero, return the current load path.

     If NARGIN is greater than zero, concatenate the arguments, separating them with 'pathsep'.  Set the internal search path to the result and return it.

     No checks are made for duplicate elements.

 -- Command: load file options
 -- Command: load file options v1 v2 ...
 -- Command: S = load ("file", "options", "v1", "v2", ...)
     Load the named variables V1, V2, ..., from the file FILE.

     If no variables are specified then all variables found in the file will be loaded.  As with 'save', the list of variables to extract can be full names or use a pattern syntax.  The format of the file is automatically detected but may be overridden by supplying the appropriate option.

     If load is invoked using the functional form

          load ("-option1", ..., "file", "v1", ...)

     then the OPTIONS, FILE, and variable name arguments (V1, ...) must be specified as character strings.

     If a variable that is not marked as global is loaded from a file when a global symbol with the same name already exists, it is loaded in the global symbol table.  Also, if a variable is marked as global in a file and a local symbol exists, the local symbol is moved to the global symbol table and given the value from the file.

     If invoked with a single output argument, Octave returns data instead of inserting variables in the symbol table.  If the data file contains only numbers (TAB- or space-delimited columns), a matrix of values is returned.  Otherwise, 'load' returns a structure with members corresponding to the names of the variables in the file.

     The 'load' command can read data stored in Octave's text and binary formats, and MATLAB's binary format.  If compiled with zlib support, it can also load gzip-compressed files.  It will automatically detect the type of file and do conversion from different floating point formats (currently only IEEE big and little endian, though other formats may be added in the future).

     Valid options for 'load' are listed in the following table.

     '-force'
          This option is accepted for backward compatibility but is ignored.  Octave now overwrites variables currently in memory with those of the same name found in the file.

     '-ascii'
          Force Octave to assume the file contains columns of numbers in text format without any header or other information.  Data in the file will be loaded as a single numeric matrix with the name of the variable derived from the name of the file.

     '-binary'
          Force Octave to assume the file is in Octave's binary format.

     '-hdf5'
          Force Octave to assume the file is in HDF5 format.  (HDF5 is a free, portable binary format developed by the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois.)  Note that Octave can read HDF5 files not created by itself, but may skip some datasets in formats that it cannot support.  This format is only available if Octave was built with a link to the HDF5 libraries.

     '-import'
          This option is accepted for backward compatibility but is ignored.  Octave can now support multi-dimensional HDF data and automatically modifies variable names if they are invalid Octave identifiers.

     '-mat'
     '-mat-binary'
     '-6'
     '-v6'
     '-7'
     '-v7'
          Force Octave to assume the file is in MATLAB's version 6 or 7 binary format.

     '-mat4-binary'
     '-4'
     '-v4'
     '-V4'
          Force Octave to assume the file is in the binary format written by MATLAB version 4.

     '-text'
          Force Octave to assume the file is in Octave's text format.

 -- Command: save options file V1 V2 ...
 -- Command: save options file -struct STRUCT F1 F2 ...
 -- Command: save '"-"' V1 V2 ...
 -- Built-in Function: S = save ('"-"' V1 V2 ...)
     Save the named variables V1, V2, ..., in the file FILE.

     The special filename '-' may be used to return the content of the variables as a string.  If no variable names are listed, Octave saves all the variables in the current scope.  Otherwise, full variable names or pattern syntax can be used to specify the variables to save.  If the '-struct' modifier is used, fields F1 F2 ... of the scalar structure STRUCT are saved as if they were variables with corresponding names.  Valid options for the 'save' command are listed in the following table.  Options that modify the output format override the format specified by 'save_default_options'.

     If save is invoked using the functional form

          save ("-option1", ..., "file", "v1", ...)

     then the OPTIONS, FILE, and variable name arguments (V1, ...) must be specified as character strings.

     If called with a filename of "-", write the output to stdout if nargout is 0, otherwise return the output in a character string.

     '-append'
          Append to the destination instead of overwriting.

     '-ascii'
          Save a single matrix in a text file without header or any other information.

     '-binary'
          Save the data in Octave's binary data format.

     '-float-binary'
          Save the data in Octave's binary data format but only using single precision.  Only use this format if you know that all the values to be saved can be represented in single precision.

     '-hdf5'
          Save the data in HDF5 format.  (HDF5 is a free, portable binary format developed by the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois.)  This format is only available if Octave was built with a link to the HDF5 libraries.

     '-float-hdf5'
          Save the data in HDF5 format but only using single precision.  Only use this format if you know that all the values to be saved can be represented in single precision.

     '-V7'
     '-v7'
     '-7'
     '-mat7-binary'
          Save the data in MATLAB's v7 binary data format.

     '-V6'
     '-v6'
     '-6'
     '-mat'
     '-mat-binary'
          Save the data in MATLAB's v6 binary data format.

     '-V4'
     '-v4'
     '-4'
     '-mat4-binary'
          Save the data in the binary format written by MATLAB version 4.

     '-text'
          Save the data in Octave's text data format.  (default).

     '-zip'
     '-z'
          Use the gzip algorithm to compress the file.  This works equally on files that are compressed with gzip outside of octave, and gzip can equally be used to convert the files for backward compatibility.  This option is only available if Octave was built with a link to the zlib libraries.

     The list of variables to save may use wildcard patterns containing the following special characters:

     '?'
          Match any single character.

     '*'
          Match zero or more characters.

     '[ LIST ]'
          Match the list of characters specified by LIST.  If the first character is '!' or '^', match all characters except those specified by LIST.  For example, the pattern '[a-zA-Z]' will match all lower and uppercase alphabetic characters.

          Wildcards may also be used in the field name specifications when using the '-struct' modifier (but not in the struct name itself).

     Except when using the MATLAB binary data file format or the '-ascii' format, saving global variables also saves the global status of the variable.  If the variable is restored at a later time using 'load', it will be restored as a global variable.

     The command

          save -binary data a b*

     saves the variable 'a' and all variables beginning with 'b' to the file 'data' in Octave's binary format.

 -- Built-in Function: IDX = lookup (TABLE, Y)
 -- Built-in Function: IDX = lookup (TABLE, Y, OPT)
     Lookup values in a sorted table.

     This function is usually used as a prelude to interpolation.

     If table is increasing and 'idx = lookup (table, y)', then 'table(idx(i)) <= y(i) < table(idx(i+1))' for all 'y(i)' within the table.  If 'y(i) < table(1)' then 'idx(i)' is 0.  If 'y(i) >= table(end)' or 'isnan (y(i))' then 'idx(i)' is 'n'.

     If the table is decreasing, then the tests are reversed.  For non-strictly monotonic tables, empty intervals are always skipped.  The result is undefined if TABLE is not monotonic, or if TABLE contains a NaN.

     The complexity of the lookup is O(M*log(N)) where N is the size of TABLE and M is the size of Y.  In the special case when Y is also sorted, the complexity is O(min(M*log(N),M+N)).

     TABLE and Y can also be cell arrays of strings (or Y can be a single string).  In this case, string lookup is performed using lexicographical comparison.

     If OPTS is specified, it must be a string with letters indicating additional options.

     'm'
          'table(idx(i)) == val(i)' if 'val(i)' occurs in table; otherwise, 'idx(i)' is zero.

     'b'
          'idx(i)' is a logical 1 or 0, indicating whether 'val(i)' is contained in table or not.

     'l'
          For numeric lookups the leftmost subinterval shall be extended to infinity (i.e., all indices at least 1)

     'r'
          For numeric lookups the rightmost subinterval shall be extended to infinity (i.e., all indices at most n-1).

     Query or set options for the function 'lsode'.

     When called with no arguments, the names of all available options and their current values are displayed.

     Given one argument, return the value of the option OPT.

     When called with two arguments, 'lsode_options' sets the option OPT to value VAL.

     Options include

     '"absolute tolerance"'
          Absolute tolerance.  May be either vector or scalar.  If a vector, it must match the dimension of the state vector.

     '"relative tolerance"'
          Relative tolerance parameter.  Unlike the absolute tolerance, this parameter may only be a scalar.

          The local error test applied at each integration step is

                 abs (local error in x(i)) <= ...
                     rtol * abs (y(i)) + atol(i)

     '"integration method"'
          A string specifying the method of integration to use to solve the ODE system.  Valid values are

          "adams"
          "non-stiff"
               No Jacobian used (even if it is available).

          "bdf"
          "stiff"
               Use stiff backward differentiation formula (BDF) method.  If a function to compute the Jacobian is not supplied, 'lsode' will compute a finite difference approximation of the Jacobian matrix.

     '"initial step size"'
          The step size to be attempted on the first step (default is determined automatically).

     '"maximum order"'
          Restrict the maximum order of the solution method.  If using the Adams method, this option must be between 1 and 12.  Otherwise, it must be between 1 and 5, inclusive.

     '"maximum step size"'
          Setting the maximum stepsize will avoid passing over very large regions (default is not specified).

     '"minimum step size"'
          The minimum absolute step size allowed (default is 0).

     '"step limit"'
          Maximum number of steps allowed (default is 100000).

     Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solver.

     The set of differential equations to solve is

          dx
          -- = f (x, t)
          dt

     with

          x(t_0) = x_0

     The solution is returned in the matrix X, with each row corresponding to an element of the vector T.  The first element of T should be t_0 and should correspond to the initial state of the system X_0, so that the first row of the output is X_0.

     The first argument, FCN, is a string, inline, or function handle that names the function f to call to compute the vector of right hand sides for the set of equations.  The function must have the form

          XDOT = f (X, T)

     in which XDOT and X are vectors and T is a scalar.

     If FCN is a two-element string array or a two-element cell array of strings, inline functions, or function handles, the first element names the function f described above, and the second element names a function to compute the Jacobian of f.  The Jacobian function must have the form

          JAC = j (X, T)

     in which JAC is the matrix of partial derivatives

     The second and third arguments specify the initial state of the system, x_0, and the initial value of the independent variable t_0.

     The fourth argument is optional, and may be used to specify a set of times that the ODE solver should not integrate past.  It is useful for avoiding difficulties with singularities and points where there is a discontinuity in the derivative.

     After a successful computation, the value of ISTATE will be 2 (consistent with the Fortran version of LSODE).

     If the computation is not successful, ISTATE will be something other than 2 and MSG will contain additional information.

     You can use the function 'lsode_options' to set optional parameters for 'lsode'.

     Compute the LU decomposition of A.

     If A is full subroutines from LAPACK are used and if A is sparse then UMFPACK is used.

     The result is returned in a permuted form, according to the optional return value P.  For example, given the matrix 'a = [1, 2; 3, 4]',

          [l, u, p] = lu (A)

     returns

          l =

            1.00000  0.00000
            0.33333  1.00000

          u =

            3.00000  4.00000
            0.00000  0.66667

          p =

            0  1
            1  0

     The matrix is not required to be square.

     When called with two or three output arguments and a spare input matrix, 'lu' does not attempt to perform sparsity preserving column permutations.  Called with a fourth output argument, the sparsity preserving column transformation Q is returned, such that 'P * A * Q = L * U'.

     Called with a fifth output argument and a sparse input matrix, 'lu' attempts to use a scaling factor R on the input matrix such that 'P * (R \ A) * Q = L * U'.  This typically leads to a sparser and more stable factorization.

     An additional input argument THRES, that defines the pivoting threshold can be given.  THRES can be a scalar, in which case it defines the UMFPACK pivoting tolerance for both symmetric and unsymmetric cases.  If THRES is a 2-element vector, then the first element defines the pivoting tolerance for the unsymmetric UMFPACK pivoting strategy and the second for the symmetric strategy.  By default, the values defined by 'spparms' are used ([0.1, 0.001]).

     Given the string argument "vector", 'lu' returns the values of P and Q as vector values, such that for full matrix, 'A (P,:) = L * U', and 'R(P,:) * A (:, Q) = L * U'.

     With two output arguments, returns the permuted forms of the upper and lower triangular matrices, such that 'A = L * U'.  With one output argument Y, then the matrix returned by the LAPACK routines is returned.  If the input matrix is sparse then the matrix L is embedded into U to give a return value similar to the full case.  For both full and sparse matrices, 'lu' loses the permutation information.

 -- Built-in Function: [L, U] = luupdate (L, U, X, Y)
 -- Built-in Function: [L, U, P] = luupdate (L, U, P, X, Y)
     Given an LU factorization of a real or complex matrix A = L*U, L lower unit trapezoidal and U upper trapezoidal, return the LU factorization of A + X*Y.', where X and Y are column vectors (rank-1 update) or matrices with equal number of columns (rank-k update).

     Optionally, row-pivoted updating can be used by supplying a row permutation (pivoting) matrix P; in that case, an updated permutation matrix is returned.  Note that if L, U, P is a pivoted LU factorization as obtained by 'lu':

          [L, U, P] = lu (A);

     then a factorization of A+X*Y.'  can be obtained either as

          [L1, U1] = lu (L, U, P*X, Y)

     or

          [L1, U1, P1] = lu (L, U, P, X, Y)

     The first form uses the unpivoted algorithm, which is faster, but less stable.  The second form uses a slower pivoted algorithm, which is more stable.

     The matrix case is done as a sequence of rank-1 updates; thus, for large enough k, it will be both faster and more accurate to recompute the factorization from scratch.

 -- Mapping Function: sign (X)
     Compute the "signum" function.

     This is defined as

          sign (x) =  0, x = 0;
                      1, x > 0.

     For complex arguments, 'sign' returns 'x ./ abs (X)'.

     Note that 'sign (-0.0)' is 0.  Although IEEE 754 floating point allows zero to be signed, 0.0 and -0.0 compare equal.  If you must test whether zero is signed, use the 'signbit' function.

     See also: signbit.

     This behavior is consistent with the other logical functions.  See *note Logical Values::.  The behavior differs from the C language function which returns nonzero if the sign bit is set.

     This is not the same as 'x < 0.0', because IEEE 754 floating point allows zero to be signed.  The comparison '-0.0 < 0.0' is false, but 'signbit (-0.0)' will return a nonzero value.

 -- Built-in Function: A = matrix_type (A, "banded", NL, NU)
     Identify the matrix type or mark a matrix as a particular type.

     This allows more rapid solutions of linear equations involving A to be performed.

     Called with a single argument, 'matrix_type' returns the type of the matrix and caches it for future use.

     Called with more than one argument, 'matrix_type' allows the type of the matrix to be defined.

     If the option "nocompute" is given, the function will not attempt to guess the type if it is still unknown.  This is useful for debugging purposes.

     The possible matrix types depend on whether the matrix is full or sparse, and can be one of the following

     "unknown"
          Remove any previously cached matrix type, and mark type as unknown.

     "full"
          Mark the matrix as full.

     "positive definite"
          Probable full positive definite matrix.

     "diagonal"
          Diagonal matrix.  (Sparse matrices only)

     "permuted diagonal"
          Permuted Diagonal matrix.  The permutation does not need to be specifically indicated, as the structure of the matrix explicitly gives this.  (Sparse matrices only)

     "upper"
          Upper triangular.  If the optional third argument PERM is given, the matrix is assumed to be a permuted upper triangular with the permutations defined by the vector PERM.

     "lower"
          Lower triangular.  If the optional third argument PERM is given, the matrix is assumed to be a permuted lower triangular with the permutations defined by the vector PERM.

     "banded"
     "banded positive definite"
          Banded matrix with the band size of NL below the diagonal and NU above it.  If NL and NU are 1, then the matrix is tridiagonal and treated with specialized code.  In addition the matrix can be marked as probably a positive definite.  (Sparse matrices only)

     "singular"
          The matrix is assumed to be singular and will be treated with a minimum norm solution.

     Note that the matrix type will be discovered automatically on the first attempt to solve a linear equation involving A.  Therefore 'matrix_type' is only useful to give Octave hints of the matrix type.  Incorrectly defining the matrix type will result in incorrect results from solutions of linear equations; it is entirely *the responsibility of the user* to correctly identify the matrix type.

     Also, the test for positive definiteness is a low-cost test for a Hermitian matrix with a real positive diagonal.  This does not guarantee that the matrix is positive definite, but only that it is a probable candidate.  When such a matrix is factorized, a Cholesky factorization is first attempted, and if that fails the matrix is then treated with an LU factorization.  Once the matrix has been factorized, 'matrix_type' will return the correct classification of the matrix.

 -- Built-in Function: min (X, Y)
     Find minimum values in the array X.

     For a vector argument, return the minimum value.  For a matrix argument, return a row vector with the minimum value of each column.  For a multi-dimensional array, 'min' operates along the first non-singleton dimension.

     If the optional third argument DIM is present then operate along this dimension.  In this case the second argument is ignored and should be set to the empty matrix.

     For two matrices (or a matrix and a scalar), return the pairwise minimum.

     Thus,

          min (min (X))

     returns the smallest element of the 2-D matrix X, and

          min (2:5, pi)
              =>  2.0000  3.0000  3.1416  3.1416

     compares each element of the range '2:5' with 'pi', and returns a row vector of the minimum values.

     For complex arguments, the magnitude of the elements are used for comparison.  If the magnitudes are identical, then the results are ordered by phase angle in the range (-pi, pi].  Hence,

          min ([-1 i 1 -i])
              => -i

     because all entries have magnitude 1, but -i has the smallest phase angle with value -pi/2.

     If called with one input and two output arguments, 'min' also returns the first index of the minimum value(s).  Thus,

          [x, ix] = min ([1, 3, 0, 2, 0])
              =>  x = 0
                  ix = 3

     For a vector argument, return the maximum value.  For a matrix argument, return a row vector with the maximum value of each column.  For a multi-dimensional array, 'max' operates along the first non-singleton dimension.

     If the optional third argument DIM is present then operate along this dimension.  In this case the second argument is ignored and should be set to the empty matrix.

     For two matrices (or a matrix and a scalar), return the pairwise maximum.

     Thus,

          max (max (X))

     returns the largest element of the 2-D matrix X, and

          max (2:5, pi)
              =>  3.1416  3.1416  4.0000  5.0000

     compares each element of the range '2:5' with 'pi', and returns a row vector of the maximum values.

     For complex arguments, the magnitude of the elements are used for comparison.  If the magnitudes are identical, then the results are ordered by phase angle in the range (-pi, pi].  Hence,

          max ([-1 i 1 -i])
              => -1

     because all entries have magnitude 1, but -1 has the largest phase angle with value pi.

     If called with one input and two output arguments, 'max' also returns the first index of the maximum value(s).  Thus,

          [x, ix] = max ([1, 3, 5, 2, 5])
              =>  x = 5
                  ix = 3

     Return the cumulative minimum values along dimension DIM.

     If DIM is unspecified it defaults to column-wise operation.  For example:

          cummin ([5 4 6 2 3 1])
             =>  5  4  4  2  2  1

     If called with two output arguments the index of the minimum value is also returned.

 -- Command: edit_history
 -- Command: edit_history CMD_NUMBER
 -- Command: edit_history FIRST LAST
     Edit the history list using the editor named by the variable 'EDITOR'.

     The commands to be edited are first copied to a temporary file.  When you exit the editor, Octave executes the commands that remain in the file.  It is often more convenient to use 'edit_history' to define functions rather than attempting to enter them directly on the command line.  The block of commands is executed as soon as you exit the editor.  To avoid executing any commands, simply delete all the lines from the buffer before leaving the editor.

     When invoked with no arguments, edit the previously executed command; With one argument, edit the specified command CMD_NUMBER; With two arguments, edit the list of commands between FIRST and LAST.  Command number specifiers may also be negative where -1 refers to the most recently executed command.  The following are equivalent and edit the most recently executed command.

          edit_history
          edit_history -1

     When using ranges, specifying a larger number for the first command than the last command reverses the list of commands before they are placed in the buffer to be edited.

     If invoked with no arguments, 'history' displays a list of commands that you have executed.

     Valid options are:

     'N'
     '-N'
          Display only the most recent N lines of history.

     '-c'
          Clear the history list.

     '-q'
          Don't number the displayed lines of history.  This is useful for cutting and pasting commands using the X Window System.

     '-r FILE'
          Read the file FILE, appending its contents to the current history list.  If the name is omitted, use the default history file (normally '~/.octave_hist').

     '-w FILE'
          Write the current history to the file FILE.  If the name is omitted, use the default history file (normally '~/.octave_hist').

     For example, to display the five most recent commands that you have typed without displaying line numbers, use the command 'history -q 5'.

     If invoked with a single output argument, the history will be saved to that argument as a cell string and will not be output to screen.

     Run commands from the history list.

     When invoked with no arguments, run the previously executed command;

     With one argument, run the specified command CMD_NUMBER;

     With two arguments, run the list of commands between FIRST and LAST.  Command number specifiers may also be negative where -1 refers to the most recently executed command.  For example, the command

          run_history
               OR
          run_history -1

     executes the most recent command again.  The command

          run_history 13 169

     executes commands 13 through 169.

     Specifying a larger number for the first command than the last command reverses the list of commands before executing them.  For example:

          disp (1)
          disp (2)
          run_history -1 -2

     Query or set the internal variable that specifies how commands are saved to the history list.

     The default value is an empty character string, but may be overridden by the environment variable 'OCTAVE_HISTCONTROL'.

     The value of 'history_control' is a colon-separated list of values controlling how commands are saved on the history list.  If the list of values includes 'ignorespace', lines which begin with a space character are not saved in the history list.  A value of 'ignoredups' causes lines matching the previous history entry to not be saved.  A value of 'ignoreboth' is shorthand for 'ignorespace' and 'ignoredups'.  A value of 'erasedups' causes all previous lines matching the current line to be removed from the history list before that line is saved.  Any value not in the above list is ignored.  If 'history_control' is the empty string, all commands are saved on the history list, subject to the value of 'history_save'.

 -- Loadable Function: [UR, SR] = ordschur (U, S, SELECT)
     Reorders the real Schur factorization (U,S) obtained with the 'schur' function, so that selected eigenvalues appear in the upper left diagonal blocks of the quasi triangular Schur matrix.

     The logical vector SELECT specifies the selected eigenvalues as they appear along S's diagonal.

     For example, given the matrix 'A = [1, 2; 3, 4]', and its Schur decomposition

          [U, S] = schur (A)

     which returns

          U =

            -0.82456  -0.56577
             0.56577  -0.82456

            -0.37228  -1.00000
             0.00000   5.37228

 -- Built-in Function: disp (X)
     Display the value of X.

     For example:

          disp ("The value of pi is:"), disp (pi)

               -| the value of pi is:
               -| 3.1416

     Note that the output from 'disp' always ends with a newline.

     If an output value is requested, 'disp' prints nothing and returns the formatted output in a string.

 -- Command: format
 -- Command: format options
     Reset or specify the format of the output produced by 'disp' and Octave's normal echoing mechanism.

     This command only affects the display of numbers but not how they are stored or computed.  To change the internal representation from the default double use one of the conversion functions such as 'single', 'uint8', 'int64', etc.

     By default, Octave displays 5 significant digits in a human readable form (option 'short' paired with 'loose' format for matrices).  If 'format' is invoked without any options, this default format is restored.

     Valid formats for floating point numbers are listed in the following table.

     'short'
          Fixed point format with 5 significant figures in a field that is a maximum of 10 characters wide.  (default).

          If Octave is unable to format a matrix so that columns line up on the decimal point and all numbers fit within the maximum field width then it switches to an exponential 'e' format.

     'long'
          Fixed point format with 15 significant figures in a field that is a maximum of 20 characters wide.

          As with the 'short' format, Octave will switch to an exponential 'e' format if it is unable to format a matrix properly using the current format.

     'short e'
     'long e'
          Exponential format.  The number to be represented is split between a mantissa and an exponent (power of 10).  The mantissa has 5 significant digits in the short format and 15 digits in the long format.  For example, with the 'short e' format, 'pi' is displayed as '3.1416e+00'.

     'short E'
     'long E'
          Identical to 'short e' or 'long e' but displays an uppercase 'E' to indicate the exponent.  For example, with the 'long E' format, 'pi' is displayed as '3.14159265358979E+00'.

     'short g'
     'long g'
          Optimally choose between fixed point and exponential format based on the magnitude of the number.  For example, with the 'short g' format, 'pi .^ [2; 4; 8; 16; 32]' is displayed as

               ans =

                     9.8696
                     97.409
                     9488.5
                 9.0032e+07
                 8.1058e+15

     'short eng'
     'long eng'
          Identical to 'short e' or 'long e' but displays the value using an engineering format, where the exponent is divisible by 3.  For example, with the 'short eng' format, '10 * pi' is displayed as '31.4159e+00'.

     'long G'
     'short G'
          Identical to 'short g' or 'long g' but displays an uppercase 'E' to indicate the exponent.

     'free'
     'none'
          Print output in free format, without trying to line up columns of matrices on the decimal point.  This also causes complex numbers to be formatted as numeric pairs like this '(0.60419, 0.60709)' instead of like this '0.60419 + 0.60709i'.

     The following formats affect all numeric output (floating point and integer types).

     '"+"'
     '"+" CHARS'
     'plus'
     'plus CHARS'
          Print a '+' symbol for matrix elements greater than zero, a '-' symbol for elements less than zero and a space for zero matrix elements.  This format can be very useful for examining the structure of a large sparse matrix.

          The optional argument CHARS specifies a list of 3 characters to use for printing values greater than zero, less than zero and equal to zero.  For example, with the '"+" "+-."' format, '[1, 0, -1; -1, 0, 1]' is displayed as

               ans =

               +.-
               -.+

     'bank'
          Print in a fixed format with two digits to the right of the decimal point.

     'native-hex'
          Print the hexadecimal representation of numbers as they are stored in memory.  For example, on a workstation which stores 8 byte real values in IEEE format with the least significant byte first, the value of 'pi' when printed in 'native-hex' format is '400921fb54442d18'.

     'hex'
          The same as 'native-hex', but always print the most significant byte first.

     'native-bit'
          Print the bit representation of numbers as stored in memory.  For example, the value of 'pi' is

               01000000000010010010000111111011
               01010100010001000010110100011000

          (shown here in two 32 bit sections for typesetting purposes) when printed in native-bit format on a workstation which stores 8 byte real values in IEEE format with the least significant byte first.

     'bit'
          The same as 'native-bit', but always print the most significant bits first.

     'rat'
          Print a rational approximation, i.e., values are approximated as the ratio of small integers.  For example, with the 'rat' format, 'pi' is displayed as '355/113'.

     The following two options affect the display of all matrices.

     'compact'
          Remove blank lines around column number labels and between matrices producing more compact output with more data per page.

     'loose'
          Insert blank lines above and below column number labels and between matrices to produce a more readable output with less data per page.  (default).

     Query or set the internal variable that controls whether Octave will use a scaled format to print matrix values.

     The scaled format prints a scaling factor on the first line of output chosen such that the largest matrix element can be written with a single leading digit.  For example:

          logspace (1, 7, 5)'
          ans =

            1.0e+07  *

            0.00000
            0.00003
            0.00100
            0.03162
            1.00000

     Notice that the first value appears to be 0 when it is actually 1.  Because of the possibility for confusion you should be careful about enabling 'fixed_point_format'.

     When called from inside a function with the "local" option, the variable is changed locally for the function and any subroutines it calls.  The original variable value is restored when exiting the function.

     Numerically evaluate the integral of F from A to B using Fortran routines from QUADPACK.

     F is a function handle, inline function, or a string containing the name of the function to evaluate.  The function must have the form 'y = f (x)' where Y and X are scalars.

     A and B are the lower and upper limits of integration.  Either or both may be infinite.

     The optional argument TOL is a vector that specifies the desired accuracy of the result.  The first element of the vector is the desired absolute tolerance, and the second element is the desired relative tolerance.  To choose a relative test only, set the absolute tolerance to zero.  To choose an absolute test only, set the relative tolerance to zero.  Both tolerances default to 'sqrt (eps)' or approximately 1.5e^{-8}.

     The optional argument SING is a vector of values at which the integrand is known to be singular.

     The result of the integration is returned in Q.

     IER contains an integer error code (0 indicates a successful integration).

     NFUN indicates the number of function evaluations that were made.

     ERR contains an estimate of the error in the solution.

     The function 'quad_options' can set other optional parameters for 'quad'.

     Note: because 'quad' is written in Fortran it cannot be called recursively.  This prevents its use in integrating over more than one variable by routines 'dblquad' and 'triplequad'.

     Numerically evaluate the integral of F from A to B using doubly-adaptive Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature.

     F is a function handle, inline function, or string containing the name of the function to evaluate.  The function F must be vectorized and must return a vector of output values if given a vector of input values.  For example,

          f = @(x) x .* sin (1./x) .* sqrt (abs (1 - x));

     which uses the element-by-element "dot" form for all operators.

     A and B are the lower and upper limits of integration.  Either or both limits may be infinite.  'quadcc' handles an inifinite limit by substituting the variable of integration with 'x = tan (pi/2*u)'.

     The optional argument TOL defines the relative tolerance used to stop the integration procedure.  The default value is 1e^{-6}.

     The optional argument SING contains a list of points where the integrand has known singularities, or discontinuities in any of its derivatives, inside the integration interval.  For the example above, which has a discontinuity at x=1, the call to 'quadcc' would be as follows

          int = quadcc (f, a, b, 1.0e-6, [ 1 ]);

     The result of the integration is returned in Q.

     ERR is an estimate of the absolute integration error.

     NR_POINTS is the number of points at which the integrand was evaluated.

     If the adaptive integration did not converge, the value of ERR will be larger than the requested tolerance.  Therefore, it is recommended to verify this value for difficult integrands.

     'quadcc' is capable of dealing with non-numeric values of the integrand such as 'NaN' or 'Inf'.  If the integral diverges, and 'quadcc' detects this, then a warning is issued and 'Inf' or '-Inf' is returned.

     Note: 'quadcc' is a general purpose quadrature algorithm and, as such, may be less efficient for a smooth or otherwise well-behaved integrand than other methods such as 'quadgk'.

     The algorithm uses Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature rules of increasing degree in each interval and bisects the interval if either the function does not appear to be smooth or a rule of maximum degree has been reached.  The error estimate is computed from the L2-norm of the difference between two successive interpolations of the integrand over the nodes of the respective quadrature rules.

 -- Built-in Function: LAMBDA = qz (A, B)
 -- Built-in Function: LAMBDA = qz (A, B, OPT)
     QZ decomposition of the generalized eigenvalue problem (A x = s B x).

     There are three ways to call this function:
       1. 'LAMBDA = qz (A, B)'

          Computes the generalized eigenvalues LAMBDA of (A - s B).

       2. '[AA, BB, Q, Z, V, W, LAMBDA] = qz (A, B)'

          Computes QZ decomposition, generalized eigenvectors, and generalized eigenvalues of (A - s B)


               A * V = B * V * diag (LAMBDA)
               W' * A = diag (LAMBDA) * W' * B
               AA = Q * A * Z, BB = Q * B * Z


          with Q and Z orthogonal (unitary)= I

       3. '[AA,BB,Z{, LAMBDA}] = qz (A, B, OPT)'

          As in form [2], but allows ordering of generalized eigenpairs for, e.g., solution of discrete time algebraic Riccati equations.  Form 3 is not available for complex matrices, and does not compute the generalized eigenvectors V, W, nor the orthogonal matrix Q.

          OPT
               for ordering eigenvalues of the GEP pencil.  The leading block of the revised pencil contains all eigenvalues that satisfy:

               "N"
                    = unordered (default)

               "S"
                    = small: leading block has all |lambda| <= 1

               "B"
                    = big: leading block has all |lambda| >= 1

               "-"
                    = negative real part: leading block has all eigenvalues in the open left half-plane

               "+"
                    = non-negative real part: leading block has all eigenvalues in the closed right half-plane

     Note: 'qz' performs permutation balancing, but not scaling (*note XREFbalance::).  The order of output arguments was selected for compatibility with MATLAB.

     Return a matrix with random elements uniformly distributed on the interval (0, 1).

     The arguments are handled the same as the arguments for 'eye'.

     You can query the state of the random number generator using the form

          v = rand ("state")

     This returns a column vector V of length 625.  Later, you can restore the random number generator to the state V using the form

          rand ("state", v)

     You may also initialize the state vector from an arbitrary vector of length <= 625 for V.  This new state will be a hash based on the value of V, not V itself.

     By default, the generator is initialized from '/dev/urandom' if it is available, otherwise from CPU time, wall clock time, and the current fraction of a second.  Note that this differs from MATLAB, which always initializes the state to the same state at startup.  To obtain behavior comparable to MATLAB, initialize with a deterministic state vector in Octave's startup files (*note Startup Files::).

     To compute the pseudo-random sequence, 'rand' uses the Mersenne Twister with a period of 2^{19937}-1 (See M. Matsumoto and T. Nishimura, 'Mersenne Twister: A 623-dimensionally equidistributed uniform pseudorandom number generator', ACM Trans.  on Modeling and Computer Simulation Vol.  8, No.  1, pp.  3-30, January 1998, <http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/emt.html>).  Do *not* use for cryptography without securely hashing several returned values together, otherwise the generator state can be learned after reading 624 consecutive values.

     Older versions of Octave used a different random number generator.  The new generator is used by default as it is significantly faster than the old generator, and produces random numbers with a significantly longer cycle time.  However, in some circumstances it might be desirable to obtain the same random sequences as produced by the old generators.  To do this the keyword "seed" is used to specify that the old generators should be used, as in

          rand ("seed", val)

     which sets the seed of the generator to VAL.  The seed of the generator can be queried with

          s = rand ("seed")

     However, it should be noted that querying the seed will not cause 'rand' to use the old generators, only setting the seed will.  To cause 'rand' to once again use the new generators, the keyword "state" should be used to reset the state of the 'rand'.

     The state or seed of the generator can be reset to a new random value using the "reset" keyword.

     The class of the value returned can be controlled by a trailing "double" or "single" argument.  These are the only valid classes.

     Return a matrix with normally distributed random elements having zero mean and variance one.

     The arguments are handled the same as the arguments for 'rand'.

     By default, 'randn' uses the Marsaglia and Tsang "Ziggurat technique" to transform from a uniform to a normal distribution.

     The class of the value returned can be controlled by a trailing "double" or "single" argument.  These are the only valid classes.

     Return a matrix with 'gamma (A,1)' distributed random elements.

     The arguments are handled the same as the arguments for 'rand', except for the argument A.

     This can be used to generate many distributions:

               r = r1 / r2


     negative 'binomial (n, p)' for 'n > 0', '0 < p <= 1'

               r(df > 0) += 2 * randg (df(df > 0)/2)

     Return a matrix with Poisson distributed random elements with mean value parameter given by the first argument, L.

     The arguments are handled the same as the arguments for 'rand', except for the argument L.

     Five different algorithms are used depending on the range of L and whether or not L is a scalar or a matrix.

     For scalar L <= 12, use direct method.
          W.H. Press, et al., 'Numerical Recipes in C', Cambridge University Press, 1992.

     For scalar L > 12, use rejection method.[1]
          W.H. Press, et al., 'Numerical Recipes in C', Cambridge University Press, 1992.

     For matrix L <= 10, use inversion method.[2]
          E. Stadlober, et al., WinRand source code, available via FTP.

     For matrix L > 10, use patchwork rejection method.

     Return a row vector containing a random permutation of '1:N'.

     If M is supplied, return M unique entries, sampled without replacement from '1:N'.

     The complexity is O(N) in memory and O(M) in time, unless M < N/5, in which case O(M) memory is used as well.  The randomization is performed using rand().  All permutations are equally likely.

     Compute the 1-norm estimate of the reciprocal condition number as returned by LAPACK.

     If the matrix is well-conditioned then C will be near 1 and if the matrix is poorly conditioned it will be close to 0.

     The matrix A must not be sparse.  If the matrix is sparse then 'condest (A)' or 'rcond (full (A))' should be used instead.

 -- Built-in Function: [S, E, TE, M, T, NM, SP] = regexp (STR, PAT)
 -- Built-in Function: [...] = regexp (STR, PAT, "OPT1", ...)
     Regular expression string matching.

     Search for PAT in STR and return the positions and substrings of any matches, or empty values if there are none.

     The matched pattern PAT can include any of the standard regex operators, including:

     '.'
          Match any character

     '* + ? {}'
          Repetition operators, representing

          '*'
               Match zero or more times

          '+'
               Match one or more times

          '?'
               Match zero or one times

          '{N}'
               Match exactly N times

          '{N,}'
               Match N or more times

          '{M,N}'
               Match between M and N times

     '[...] [^...]'

          List operators.  The pattern will match any character listed between "[" and "]".  If the first character is "^" then the pattern is inverted and any character except those listed between brackets will match.

          Escape sequences defined below can also be used inside list operators.  For example, a template for a floating point number might be '[-+.\d]+'.

     '() (?:)'
          Grouping operator.  The first form, parentheses only, also creates a token.

     '|'
          Alternation operator.  Match one of a choice of regular expressions.  The alternatives must be delimited by the grouping operator '()' above.

     '^ $'
          Anchoring operators.  Requires pattern to occur at the start ('^') or end ('$') of the string.

     In addition, the following escaped characters have special meaning.

     '\d'
          Match any digit

     '\D'
          Match any non-digit

     '\s'
          Match any whitespace character

     '\S'
          Match any non-whitespace character

     '\w'
          Match any word character

     '\W'
          Match any non-word character

     '\<'
          Match the beginning of a word

     '\>'
          Match the end of a word

     '\B'
          Match within a word

     Implementation Note: For compatibility with MATLAB, escape sequences in PAT (e.g., "\n" => newline) are expanded even when PAT has been defined with single quotes.  To disable expansion use a second backslash before the escape sequence (e.g., "\\n") or use the 'regexptranslate' function.

     The outputs of 'regexp' default to the order given below

     S
          The start indices of each matching substring

     E
          The end indices of each matching substring

     TE
          The extents of each matched token surrounded by '(...)' in PAT

     M
          A cell array of the text of each match

     T
          A cell array of the text of each token matched

     NM
          A structure containing the text of each matched named token, with the name being used as the fieldname.  A named token is denoted by '(?<name>...)'.

     SP
          A cell array of the text not returned by match, i.e., what remains if you split the string based on PAT.

     Particular output arguments, or the order of the output arguments, can be selected by additional OPT arguments.  These are strings and the correspondence between the output arguments and the optional argument are

 -- Built-in Function: OUTSTR = regexprep (STRING, PAT, REPSTR)
 -- Built-in Function: OUTSTR = regexprep (STRING, PAT, REPSTR, "OPT1", ...)
     Replace occurrences of pattern PAT in STRING with REPSTR.

     The pattern is a regular expression as documented for 'regexp'.  *Note regexp: XREFregexp.

     The replacement string may contain '$i', which substitutes for the ith set of parentheses in the match string.  For example,

          regexprep ("Bill Dunn", '(\w+) (\w+)', '$2, $1')

     returns "Dunn, Bill"

     Options in addition to those of 'regexp' are

     'once'
          Replace only the first occurrence of PAT in the result.

     'warnings'
          This option is present for compatibility but is ignored.

     Implementation Note: For compatibility with MATLAB, escape sequences in PAT (e.g., "\n" => newline) are expanded even when PAT has been defined with single quotes.  To disable expansion use a second backslash before the escape sequence (e.g., "\\n") or use the 'regexptranslate' function.

 -- Built-in Function: S = schur (A, OPT)
 -- Built-in Function: [U, S] = schur (...)
     Compute the Schur decomposition of A.

     The Schur decomposition is defined as

          S = U' * A * U

     where U is a unitary matrix ('U'* U' is identity) and S is upper triangular.  The eigenvalues of A (and S) are the diagonal elements of S.  If the matrix A is real, then the real Schur decomposition is computed, in which the matrix U is orthogonal and S is block upper triangular with blocks of size at most '2 x 2' along the diagonal.  The diagonal elements of S (or the eigenvalues of the '2 x 2' blocks, when appropriate) are the eigenvalues of A and S.

     The default for real matrices is a real Schur decomposition.  A complex decomposition may be forced by passing the flag "complex".

     The eigenvalues are optionally ordered along the diagonal according to the value of OPT.  'OPT = "a"' indicates that all eigenvalues with negative real parts should be moved to the leading block of S (used in 'are'), 'OPT = "d"' indicates that all eigenvalues with magnitude less than one should be moved to the leading block of S (used in 'dare'), and 'OPT = "u"', the default, indicates that no ordering of eigenvalues should occur.  The leading K columns of U always span the A-invariant subspace corresponding to the K leading eigenvalues of S.

     The Schur decomposition is used to compute eigenvalues of a square matrix, and has applications in the solution of algebraic Riccati equations in control (see 'are' and 'dare').

     Create a sparse matrix from a full matrix, or row, column, value triplets.

     If A is a full matrix, convert it to a sparse matrix representation, removing all zero values in the process.

     Given the integer index vectors I and J, and a 1-by-'nnz' vector of real or complex values SV, construct the sparse matrix 'S(I(K),J(K)) = SV(K)' with overall dimensions M and N.  If any of SV, I or J are scalars, they are expanded to have a common size.

     If M or N are not specified their values are derived from the maximum index in the vectors I and J as given by 'M = max (I)', 'N = max (J)'.

     *Note*: if multiple values are specified with the same I, J indices, the corresponding value in S will be the sum of the values at the repeated location.  See 'accumarray' for an example of how to produce different behavior, such as taking the minimum instead.

     If the option "unique" is given, and more than one value is specified at the same I, J indices, then the last specified value will be used.

     'sparse (M, N)' will create an empty MxN sparse matrix and is equivalent to 'sparse ([], [], [], M, N)'

     The argument 'nzmax' is ignored but accepted for compatibility with MATLAB.

     Example 1 (sum at repeated indices):

          I = [1 1 2]; J = [1 1 2]; SV = [3 4 5];
          sparse (I, J, SV, 3, 4)
          =>
          Compressed Column Sparse (rows = 3, cols = 4, nnz = 2 [17%])

            (1, 1) ->  7
            (2, 2) ->  5

     Example 2 ("unique" option):

          I = [1 1 2]; J = [1 1 2]; SV = [3 4 5];
          sparse (I, J, SV, 3, 4, "unique")
          =>
          Compressed Column Sparse (rows = 3, cols = 4, nnz = 2 [17%])

            (1, 1) ->  4
            (2, 2) ->  5

 -- Built-in Function: S = spalloc (M, N, NZ)
     Create an M-by-N sparse matrix with pre-allocated space for at most NZ nonzero elements.

     This is useful for building a matrix incrementally by a sequence of indexed assignments.  Subsequent indexed assignments after 'spalloc' will reuse the pre-allocated memory, provided they are of one of the simple forms

        * 'S(I:J) = X'

        * 'S(:,I:J) = X'

        * 'S(K:L,I:J) = X'

     and that the following conditions are met:

        * the assignment does not decrease nnz (S).

        * after the assignment, nnz (S) does not exceed NZ.

        * no index is out of bounds.

     Partial movement of data may still occur, but in general the assignment will be more memory and time efficient under these circumstances.  In particular, it is possible to efficiently build a pre-allocated sparse matrix from a contiguous block of columns.

     The amount of pre-allocated memory for a given matrix may be queried using the function 'nzmax'.

     'autommd'
          Flag whether the LU/QR and the '\' and '/' operators will automatically use the sparsity preserving mmd functions (default 1)

     'autoamd'
          Flag whether the LU and the '\' and '/' operators will automatically use the sparsity preserving amd functions (default 1)

     'piv_tol'
          The pivot tolerance of the UMFPACK solvers (default 0.1)

     'sym_tol'
          The pivot tolerance of the UMFPACK symmetric solvers (default 0.001)

     'bandden'
          The density of nonzero elements in a banded matrix before it is treated by the LAPACK banded solvers (default 0.5)

     'umfpack'
          Flag whether the UMFPACK or mmd solvers are used for the LU, '\' and '/' operations (default 1)

     The value of individual keys can be set with 'spparms (KEY, VAL)'.  The default values can be restored with the special keyword "default".  The special keyword "tight" can be used to set the mmd solvers to attempt a sparser solution at the potential cost of longer running time.

 -- Built-in Function: str2double (S)
     Convert a string to a real or complex number.

     The string must be in one of the following formats where a and b are real numbers and the complex unit is 'i' or 'j':

        * a + bi

        * a + b*i

        * a + i*b

        * bi + a

        * b*i + a

        * i*b + a

     If present, a and/or b are of the form [+-]d[,.]d[[eE][+-]d] where the brackets indicate optional arguments and 'd' indicates zero or more digits.  The special input values 'Inf', 'NaN', and 'NA' are also accepted.

     S may be a character string, character matrix, or cell array.  For character arrays the conversion is repeated for every row, and a double or complex array is returned.  Empty rows in S are deleted and not returned in the numeric array.  For cell arrays each character string element is processed and a double or complex array of the same dimensions as S is returned.

     For unconvertible scalar or character string input 'str2double' returns a NaN.  Similarly, for character array input 'str2double' returns a NaN for any row of S that could not be converted.  For a cell array, 'str2double' returns a NaN for any element of S for which conversion fails.  Note that numeric elements in a mixed string/numeric cell array are not strings and the conversion will fail for these elements and return NaN.

     'str2double' can replace 'str2num', and it avoids the security risk of using 'eval' on unknown data.

     See also: str2num.

 -- Built-in Function: IDX = strfind (STR, PATTERN)
 -- Built-in Function: IDX = strfind (CELLSTR, PATTERN)
 -- Built-in Function: IDX = strfind (..., "overlaps", VAL)
     Search for PATTERN in the string STR and return the starting index of every such occurrence in the vector IDX.

     If there is no such occurrence, or if PATTERN is longer than STR, or if PATTERN itself is empty, then IDX is the empty array '[]'.

     The optional argument "overlaps" determines whether the pattern can match at every position in STR (true), or only for unique occurrences of the complete pattern (false).  The default is true.

     If a cell array of strings CELLSTR is specified then IDX is a cell array of vectors, as specified above.

     Examples:

          strfind ("abababa", "aba")
               => [1, 3, 5]

          strfind ("abababa", "aba", "overlaps", false)
               => [1, 5]

          strfind ({"abababa", "bebebe", "ab"}, "aba")
               =>
                  {
                    [1,1] =

                       1   3   5

                    [1,2] = [](1x0)
                    [1,3] = [](1x0)
                  }

 -- Built-in Function: NEWSTR = strrep (STR, PTN, REP)
 -- Built-in Function: NEWSTR = strrep (CELLSTR, PTN, REP)
 -- Built-in Function: NEWSTR = strrep (..., "overlaps", VAL)
     Replace all occurrences of the pattern PTN in the string STR with the string REP and return the result.

     The optional argument "overlaps" determines whether the pattern can match at every position in STR (true), or only for unique occurrences of the complete pattern (false).  The default is true.

     S may also be a cell array of strings, in which case the replacement is done for each element and a cell array is returned.

     Example:

          strrep ("This is a test string", "is", "&%$")
              =>  "Th&%$ &%$ a test string"

     Create a string array from one or more numeric matrices, character matrices, or cell arrays.

     Arguments are concatenated vertically.  The returned values are padded with blanks as needed to make each row of the string array have the same length.  Empty input strings are significant and will concatenated in the output.

     For numerical input, each element is converted to the corresponding ASCII character.  A range error results if an input is outside the ASCII range (0-255).

     For cell arrays, each element is concatenated separately.  Cell arrays converted through 'char' can mostly be converted back with 'cellstr'.  For example:

          char ([97, 98, 99], "", {"98", "99", 100}, "str1", ["ha", "lf"])
             => ["abc    "

     Create a character array from one or more numeric matrices, character matrices, or cell arrays.

     Arguments are concatenated vertically.  The returned values are padded with blanks as needed to make each row of the string array have the same length.  Unlike 'char', empty strings are removed and will not appear in the output.

     For numerical input, each element is converted to the corresponding ASCII character.  A range error results if an input is outside the ASCII range (0-255).

     For cell arrays, each element is concatenated separately.  Cell arrays converted through 'strvcat' can mostly be converted back with 'cellstr'.  For example:

          strvcat ([97, 98, 99], "", {"98", "99", 100}, "str1", ["ha", "lf"])
                => ["abc    "

     Compute the singular value decomposition of A

          A = U*S*V'

     The function 'svd' normally returns only the vector of singular values.  When called with three return values, it computes U, S, and V.  For example,

          svd (hilb (3))

     returns

          ans =

            1.4083189
            0.1223271
            0.0026873

     and

          [u, s, v] = svd (hilb (3))

     returns

          u =

            -0.82704   0.54745   0.12766
            -0.45986  -0.52829  -0.71375

            -0.32330  -0.64901   0.68867

     If given a second argument, 'svd' returns an economy-sized decomposition, eliminating the unnecessary rows or columns of U or V.

     Query or set the internal variable that controls whether Octave checks the time stamp on files each time it looks up functions defined in function files.

     If the internal variable is set to "system", Octave will not automatically recompile function files in subdirectories of 'OCTAVE-HOME/lib/VERSION' if they have changed since they were last compiled, but will recompile other function files in the search path if they change.

     If set to "all", Octave will not recompile any function files unless their definitions are removed with 'clear'.

     If set to "none", Octave will always check time stamps on files to determine whether functions defined in function files need to recompiled.

     Replace current process with a new process.

     Calling 'exec' without first calling 'fork' will terminate your current Octave process and replace it with the program named by FILE.  For example,

          exec ("ls" "-l")

     will run 'ls' and return you to your shell prompt.

     If successful, 'exec' does not return.  If 'exec' does return, ERR will be nonzero, and MSG will contain a system-dependent error message.

 -- Built-in Function: [IN, OUT, PID] = popen2 (COMMAND, ARGS)
     Start a subprocess with two-way communication.

     The name of the process is given by COMMAND, and ARGS is an array of strings containing options for the command.

     The file identifiers for the input and output streams of the subprocess are returned in IN and OUT.  If execution of the command is successful, PID contains the process ID of the subprocess.  Otherwise, PID is -1.

     For example:

          [in, out, pid] = popen2 ("sort", "-r");
          fputs (in, "these\nare\nsome\nstrings\n");
          fclose (in);

 -- Built-in Function: [PID, MSG] = fork ()
     Create a copy of the current process.

     Fork can return one of the following values:

     > 0
          You are in the parent process.  The value returned from 'fork' is the process id of the child process.  You should probably arrange to wait for any child processes to exit.

     0
          You are in the child process.  You can call 'exec' to start another process.  If that fails, you should probably call 'exit'.

     < 0
          The call to 'fork' failed for some reason.  You must take evasive action.  A system dependent error message will be waiting in MSG.

 -- Built-in Function: [PID, STATUS, MSG] = waitpid (PID, OPTIONS)
     Wait for process PID to terminate.

     The PID argument can be:

     -1
          Wait for any child process.

     0
          Wait for any child process whose process group ID is equal to that of the Octave interpreter process.

     > 0
          Wait for termination of the child process with ID PID.

     The OPTIONS argument can be a bitwise OR of zero or more of the following constants:

     '0'
          Wait until signal is received or a child process exits (this is the default if the OPTIONS argument is missing).

     'WNOHANG'
          Do not hang if status is not immediately available.

     'WUNTRACED'
          Report the status of any child processes that are stopped, and whose status has not yet been reported since they stopped.

     'WCONTINUE'
          Return if a stopped child has been resumed by delivery of 'SIGCONT'.  This value may not be meaningful on all systems.

     If the returned value of PID is greater than 0, it is the process ID of the child process that exited.  If an error occurs, PID will be less than zero and MSG will contain a system-dependent error message.  The value of STATUS contains additional system-dependent information about the subprocess that exited.

 -- Built-in Function: strftime (FMT, TM_STRUCT)
     Format the time structure TM_STRUCT in a flexible way using the format string FMT that contains '%' substitutions similar to those in 'printf'.

     Except where noted, substituted fields have a fixed size; numeric fields are padded if necessary.  Padding is with zeros by default; for fields that display a single number, padding can be changed or inhibited by following the '%' with one of the modifiers described below.  Unknown field specifiers are copied as normal characters.  All other characters are copied to the output without change.  For example:

          strftime ("%r (%Z) %A %e %B %Y", localtime (time ()))
                => "01:15:06 AM (CST) Monday 17 February 1997"

 -- Built-in Function: system ("STRING")
 -- Built-in Function: system ("STRING", RETURN_OUTPUT)
 -- Built-in Function: system ("STRING", RETURN_OUTPUT, TYPE)
 -- Built-in Function: [STATUS, OUTPUT] = system (...)
     Execute a shell command specified by STRING.

     If the optional argument TYPE is "async", the process is started in the background and the process ID of the child process is returned immediately.  Otherwise, the child process is started and Octave waits until it exits.  If the TYPE argument is omitted, it defaults to the value "sync".

     If SYSTEM is called with one or more output arguments, or if the optional argument RETURN_OUTPUT is true and the subprocess is started synchronously, then the output from the command is returned as a variable.  Otherwise, if the subprocess is executed synchronously, its output is sent to the standard output.  To send the output of a command executed with 'system' through the pager, use a command like

          [output, text] = system ("cmd");
          disp (text);

     or

          printf ("%s\n", nthargout (2, "system", "cmd"));

     The 'system' function can return two values.  The first is the exit status of the command and the second is any output from the command that was written to the standard output stream.  For example,

          [status, output] = system ("echo foo; exit 2");

     will set the variable 'output' to the string 'foo', and the variable 'status' to the integer '2'.

     For commands run asynchronously, STATUS is the process id of the command shell that is started to run the command.

     Register a function to be called when Octave exits.

     For example,

          function last_words ()
            disp ("Bye bye");
          endfunction
          atexit ("last_words");

     will print the message "Bye bye" when Octave exits.

     The additional argument FLAG will register or unregister FCN from the list of functions to be called when Octave exits.  If FLAG is true, the function is registered, and if FLAG is false, it is unregistered.  For example, after registering the function 'last_words' above,

          atexit ("last_words", false);

     will remove the function from the list and Octave will not call 'last_words' when it exits.

     Note that 'atexit' only removes the first occurrence of a function from the list, so if a function was placed in the list multiple times with 'atexit', it must also be removed from the list multiple times.

     Return a new matrix formed by extracting the lower ('tril') or upper ('triu') triangular part of the matrix A, and setting all other elements to zero.

     The second argument is optional, and specifies how many diagonals above or below the main diagonal should also be set to zero.

     The default value of K is zero, so that 'triu' and 'tril' normally include the main diagonal as part of the result.

     If the value of K is nonzero integer, the selection of elements starts at an offset of K diagonals above or below the main diagonal; above for positive K and below for negative K.

     The absolute value of K must not be greater than the number of subdiagonals or superdiagonals.

     For example:

          tril (ones (3), -1)
               =>  0  0  0
                   1  0  0
                   1  1  0

     and

                   1  1  1
                   1  1  1

     If the option "pack" is given as third argument, the extracted elements are not inserted into a matrix, but rather stacked column-wise one above other.

 -- Built-in Function: Y = typecast (X, "CLASS")
     Return a new array Y resulting from interpreting the data of X in memory as data of the numeric class CLASS.

     Both the class of X and CLASS must be one of the built-in numeric classes:

          "logical"
          "char"
          "int8"
          "int16"
          "int32"
          "int64"
          "uint8"
          "uint16"
          "uint32"
          "uint64"
          "double"
          "single"
          "double complex"
          "single complex"

     the last two are only used with CLASS; they indicate that a complex-valued result is requested.  Complex arrays are stored in memory as consecutive pairs of real numbers.  The sizes of integer types are given by their bit counts.  Both logical and char are typically one byte wide; however, this is not guaranteed by C++.  If your system is IEEE conformant, single and double will be 4 bytes and 8 bytes wide, respectively.  "logical" is not allowed for CLASS.

     If the input is a row vector, the return value is a row vector, otherwise it is a column vector.

     If the bit length of X is not divisible by that of CLASS, an error occurs.

     An example of the use of typecast on a little-endian machine is

          X = uint16 ([1, 65535]);
          typecast (X, "uint8")
          => [   1,   0, 255, 255]

 -- Built-in Function: Y = bitpack (X, CLASS)
     Return a new array Y resulting from interpreting the logical array X as raw bit patterns for data of the numeric class CLASS.

     CLASS must be one of the built-in numeric classes:

          "double"

          "double complex"
          "single complex"

          "uint8"
          "uint16"
          "uint32"
          "uint64"

     The number of elements of X should be divisible by the bit length of CLASS.  If it is not, excess bits are discarded.  Bits come in increasing order of significance, i.e., 'x(1)' is bit 0, 'x(2)' is bit 1, etc.

     The result is a row vector if X is a row vector, otherwise it is a column vector.

 -- Loadable Function: [S, SUCCESS] = urlread (URL)
 -- Loadable Function: [S, SUCCESS, MESSAGE] = urlread (URL)
 -- Loadable Function: [...] = urlread (URL, METHOD, PARAM)
     Download a remote file specified by its URL and return its content in string S.

     For example:

          s = urlread ("ftp://ftp.octave.org/pub/README");

     The variable SUCCESS is 1 if the download was successful, otherwise it is 0 in which case MESSAGE contains an error message.

     If no output argument is specified and an error occurs, then the error is signaled through Octave's error handling mechanism.

     This function uses libcurl.  Curl supports, among others, the HTTP, FTP and FILE protocols.  Username and password may be specified in the URL.  For example:

          s = urlread ("http://user:password@example.com/file.txt");

     GET and POST requests can be specified by METHOD and PARAM.  The parameter METHOD is either 'get' or 'post' and PARAM is a cell array of parameter and value pairs.  For example:

          s = urlread ("http://www.google.com/search", "get",
                      {"query", "octave"});

     Return the absolute name of FILE if it can be found in PATH.

     The value of PATH should be a colon-separated list of directories in the format described for 'path'.  If no file is found, return an empty character string.  For example:

          file_in_path (EXEC_PATH, "sh")
               => "/bin/sh"

     If the second argument is a cell array of strings, search each directory of the path for element of the cell array and return the first that matches.

 -- Built-in Function: undo_string_escapes (S)
     Convert special characters in strings back to their escaped forms.

     For example, the expression

          bell = "\a";

     assigns the value of the alert character (control-g, ASCII code 7) to the string variable 'bell'.  If this string is printed, the system will ring the terminal bell (if it is possible).  This is normally the desired outcome.  However, sometimes it is useful to be able to print the original representation of the string, with the special characters replaced by their escape sequences.  For example,

          octave:13> undo_string_escapes (bell)
          ans = \a

     replaces the unprintable alert character with its printable representation.

     Return true if IND is a valid index.

     Valid indices are either positive integers (although possibly of real data type), or logical arrays.

     If present, N specifies the maximum extent of the dimension to be indexed.  When possible the internal result is cached so that subsequent indexing using IND will not perform the check again.

     Implementation Note: Strings are first converted to double values before the checks for valid indices are made.  Unless a string contains the NULL character "\0", it will always be a valid index.

 -- Built-in Function: C = exist (NAME)
 -- Built-in Function: C = exist (NAME, TYPE)
     Check for the existence of NAME as a variable, function, file, directory, or class.

     The return code C is one of

     1
          NAME is a variable.

     2
          NAME is an absolute file name, an ordinary file in Octave's 'path', or (after appending '.m') a function file in Octave's 'path'.

     3
          NAME is a '.oct' or '.mex' file in Octave's 'path'.

     5
          NAME is a built-in function.

     7
          NAME is a directory.

     103
          NAME is a function not associated with a file (entered on the command line).

     0
          NAME does not exist.

     If the optional argument TYPE is supplied, check only for symbols of the specified type.  Valid types are

     "var"
          Check only for variables.

     "builtin"
          Check only for built-in functions.

     "dir"
          Check only for directories.

     "file"
          Check only for files and directories.

     "class"
          Check only for classes.  (Note: This option is accepted, but not currently implemented)

     If no type is given, and there are multiple possible matches for name, 'exist' will return a code according to the following priority list: variable, built-in function, oct-file, directory, file, class.

     'exist' returns 2 if a regular file called NAME is present in Octave's search path.  If you want information about other types of files not on the search path you should use some combination of the functions 'file_in_path' and 'stat' instead.

     List currently defined variables matching the given patterns.

     Valid pattern syntax is the same as described for the 'clear' command.  If no patterns are supplied, all variables are listed.

     By default, only variables visible in the local scope are displayed.

     The following are valid options, but may not be combined.

     'global'
          List variables in the global scope rather than the current scope.

     '-regexp'
          The patterns are considered to be regular expressions when matching the variables to display.  The same pattern syntax accepted by the 'regexp' function is used.

     '-file'
          The next argument is treated as a filename.  All variables found within the specified file are listed.  No patterns are accepted when reading variables from a file.

     Attr
          Attributes of the listed variable.  Possible attributes are:

          blank
               Variable in local scope

          'a'
               Automatic variable.  An automatic variable is one created by the interpreter, for example 'argn'.

          'c'
               Variable of complex type.

          'f'
               Formal parameter (function argument).

          'g'
               Variable with global scope.

          'p'
               Persistent variable.

     Name
          The name of the variable.

     Size
          The logical size of the variable.  A scalar is 1x1, a vector is 1xN or Nx1, a 2-D matrix is MxN.

     Bytes
          The amount of memory currently used to store the variable.

     Class
          The class of the variable.  Examples include double, single, char, uint16, cell, and struct.

     The table can be customized to display more or less information through the function 'whos_line_format'.

     If 'whos' is called as a function, return a struct array of defined variable names matching the given patterns.  Fields in the structure describing each variable are: name, size, bytes, class, global, sparse, complex, nesting, persistent.

 -- Command: clear [options] pattern ...
     Delete the names matching the given patterns from the symbol table.

     The pattern may contain the following special characters:

     '?'
          Match any single character.

     '*'
          Match zero or more characters.

     '[ LIST ]'
          Match the list of characters specified by LIST.  If the first character is '!' or '^', match all characters except those specified by LIST.  For example, the pattern '[a-zA-Z]' will match all lowercase and uppercase alphabetic characters.

     For example, the command

          clear foo b*r

     clears the name 'foo' and all names that begin with the letter 'b' and end with the letter 'r'.

     If 'clear' is called without any arguments, all user-defined variables (local and global) are cleared from the symbol table.

     If 'clear' is called with at least one argument, only the visible names matching the arguments are cleared.  For example, suppose you have defined a function 'foo', and then hidden it by performing the assignment 'foo = 2'.  Executing the command 'clear foo' once will clear the variable definition and restore the definition of 'foo' as a function.  Executing 'clear foo' a second time will clear the function definition.

     The following options are available in both long and short form

     '-all, -a'
          Clear all local and global user-defined variables and all functions from the symbol table.

     '-exclusive, -x'
          Clear the variables that don't match the following pattern.

     '-functions, -f'
          Clear the function names and the built-in symbols names.

     '-global, -g'
          Clear global symbol names.

     '-variables, -v'
          Clear local variable names.

     '-classes, -c'
          Clears the class structure table and clears all objects.

     '-regexp, -r'
          The arguments are treated as regular expressions as any variables that match will be cleared.

     With the exception of 'exclusive', all long options can be used without the dash as well.

     Query or set the format string used by the command 'whos'.

     A full format string is:

          %[modifier]<command>[:width[:left-min[:balance]]];

     The following command sequences are available:

     '%a'
          Prints attributes of variables (g=global, p=persistent, f=formal parameter, a=automatic variable).

     '%b'
          Prints number of bytes occupied by variables.

     '%c'
          Prints class names of variables.

     '%e'
          Prints elements held by variables.

     '%n'
          Prints variable names.

     '%s'
          Prints dimensions of variables.

     '%t'
          Prints type names of variables.

     Every command may also have an alignment modifier:

     'l'
          Left alignment.

     'r'
          Right alignment (default).

     'c'
          Column-aligned (only applicable to command %s).

     The 'width' parameter is a positive integer specifying the minimum number of columns used for printing.  No maximum is needed as the field will auto-expand as required.

     The parameters 'left-min' and 'balance' are only available when the column-aligned modifier is used with the command '%s'.  'balance' specifies the column number within the field width which will be aligned between entries.  Numbering starts from 0 which indicates the leftmost column.  'left-min' specifies the minimum field width to the left of the specified balance column.

     The default format is:

     " %a:4; %ln:6; %cs:16:6:1; %rb:12; %lc:-1;\n"

     When called from inside a function with the "local" option, the variable is changed locally for the function and any subroutines it calls.  The original variable value is restored when exiting the function.

     Query or set the internal variable that specifies the function to call when a component of Octave is missing.

     This can be useful for packagers that may split the Octave installation into multiple sub-packages, for example, to provide a hint to users for how to install the missing components.

     When called from inside a function with the "local" option, the variable is changed locally for the function and any subroutines it calls.  The original variable value is restored when exiting the function.

     The hook function is expected to be of the form

          FCN (COMPONENT)

     Octave will call FCN with the name of the function that requires the component and a string describing the missing component.  The hook function should return an error message to be displayed.

 -- Built-in Function: AUTOLOAD_MAP = autoload ()
 -- Built-in Function: autoload (FUNCTION, FILE)
 -- Built-in Function: autoload (..., "remove")
     Define FUNCTION to autoload from FILE.

     The second argument, FILE, should be an absolute file name or a file name in the same directory as the function or script from which the autoload command was run.  FILE _should not_ depend on the Octave load path.

     Normally, calls to 'autoload' appear in PKG_ADD script files that are evaluated when a directory is added to Octave's load path.  To avoid having to hardcode directory names in FILE, if FILE is in the same directory as the PKG_ADD script then

          autoload ("foo", "bar.oct");

     will load the function 'foo' from the file 'bar.oct'.  The above usage when 'bar.oct' is not in the same directory, or usages such as

          autoload ("foo", file_in_loadpath ("bar.oct"))

     are strongly discouraged, as their behavior may be unpredictable.

     With no arguments, return a structure containing the current autoload map.

     If a third argument "remove" is given, the function is cleared and not loaded anymore during the current Octave session.

 -- Built-in Function: feval (NAME, ...)
     Evaluate the function named NAME.

     Any arguments after the first are passed as inputs to the named function.  For example,

          feval ("acos", -1)
               => 3.1416

     calls the function 'acos' with the argument '-1'.

     The function 'feval' can also be used with function handles of any sort (*note Function Handles::).  Historically, 'feval' was the only way to call user-supplied functions in strings, but function handles are now preferred due to the cleaner syntax they offer.  For example,

          F = @exp;
          feval (F, 1)
              => 2.7183
          F (1)
              => 2.7183

     are equivalent ways to call the function referred to by F.  If it cannot be predicted beforehand whether F is a function handle, function name in a string, or inline function then 'feval' can be used instead.

     Call the base function F even if F is overloaded to another function for the given type signature.

     This is normally useful when doing object-oriented programming and there is a requirement to call one of Octave's base functions rather than the overloaded one of a new class.

     A trivial example which redefines the 'sin' function to be the 'cos' function shows how 'builtin' works.

          sin (0)
            => 0
          function y = sin (x), y = cos (x); endfunction
          sin (0)

eval

 -- Built-in Function: eval (TRY)
 -- Built-in Function: eval (TRY, CATCH)
     Parse the string TRY and evaluate it as if it were an Octave program.

     If execution fails, evaluate the optional string CATCH.

     The string TRY is evaluated in the current context, so any results remain available after 'eval' returns.

     The following example creates the variable A with the approximate value of 3.1416 in the current workspace.

          eval ("A = acos(-1);");

     If an error occurs during the evaluation of TRY then the CATCH string is evaluated, as the following example shows:

          eval ('error ("This is a bad example");',
                'printf ("This error occurred:\n%s\n", lasterr ());');
               -| This error occurred:
                  This is a bad example

     Programming Note: if you are only using 'eval' as an error-capturing mechanism, rather than for the execution of arbitrary code strings, Consider using try/catch blocks or unwind_protect/unwind_protect_cleanup blocks instead.  These techniques have higher performance and don't introduce the security considerations that the evaluation of arbitrary code does.

     Return the approximate minimum degree permutation of a matrix.

     This is a permutation such that the Cholesky factorization of 'S (P, P)' tends to be sparser than the Cholesky factorization of S itself.  'amd' is typically faster than 'symamd' but serves a similar purpose.

     The optional parameter OPTS is a structure that controls the behavior of 'amd'.  The fields of the structure are

     OPTS.dense
          Determines what 'amd' considers to be a dense row or column of the input matrix.  Rows or columns with more than 'max (16, (dense * sqrt (N)))' entries, where N is the order of the matrix S, are ignored by 'amd' during the calculation of the permutation.  The value of dense must be a positive scalar and the default value is 10.0

     OPTS.aggressive
          If this value is a nonzero scalar, then 'amd' performs aggressive absorption.  The default is not to perform aggressive absorption.

     Constrained column approximate minimum degree permutation.

     'P = ccolamd (S)' returns the column approximate minimum degree permutation vector for the sparse matrix S.  For a non-symmetric matrix S, 'S(:, P)' tends to have sparser LU factors than S.  'chol (S(:, P)' * S(:, P))' also tends to be sparser than 'chol (S' * S)'.  'P = ccolamd (S, 1)' optimizes the ordering for 'lu (S(:, P))'.  The ordering is followed by a column elimination tree post-ordering.

     KNOBS is an optional 1-element to 5-element input vector, with a default value of '[0 10 10 1 0]' if not present or empty.  Entries not present are set to their defaults.

     'KNOBS(1)'
          if nonzero, the ordering is optimized for 'lu (S(:, p))'.  It will be a poor ordering for 'chol (S(:, P)' * S(:, P))'.  This is the most important knob for ccolamd.

     'KNOBS(2)'
          if S is m-by-n, rows with more than 'max (16, KNOBS(2) * sqrt (n))' entries are ignored.

     'KNOBS(3)'
          columns with more than 'max (16, KNOBS(3) * sqrt (min (M, N)))' entries are ignored and ordered last in the output permutation (subject to the cmember constraints).

     'KNOBS(4)'
          if nonzero, aggressive absorption is performed.

     'KNOBS(5)'
          if nonzero, statistics and knobs are printed.

     CMEMBER is an optional vector of length n.  It defines the constraints on the column ordering.  If 'CMEMBER(j) = C', then column J is in constraint set C (C must be in the range 1 to n).  In the output permutation P, all columns in set 1 appear first, followed by all columns in set 2, and so on.  'CMEMBER = ones (1,n)' if not present or empty.  'ccolamd (S, [], 1 : n)' returns '1 : n'

     'P = ccolamd (S)' is about the same as 'P = colamd (S)'.  KNOBS and its default values differ.  'colamd' always does aggressive absorption, and it finds an ordering suitable for both 'lu (S(:, P))' and 'chol (S(:, P)' * S(:, P))'; it cannot optimize its ordering for 'lu (S(:, P))' to the extent that 'ccolamd (S, 1)' can.

     STATS is an optional 20-element output vector that provides data about the ordering and the validity of the input matrix S.  Ordering statistics are in 'STATS(1 : 3)'.  'STATS(1)' and 'STATS(2)' are the number of dense or empty rows and columns ignored by CCOLAMD and 'STATS(3)' is the number of garbage collections performed on the internal data structure used by CCOLAMD (roughly of size '2.2 * nnz (S) + 4 * M + 7 * N' integers).

     'STATS(4 : 7)' provide information if CCOLAMD was able to continue.  The matrix is OK if 'STATS(4)' is zero, or 1 if invalid.  'STATS(5)' is the rightmost column index that is unsorted or contains duplicate entries, or zero if no such column exists.  'STATS(6)' is the last seen duplicate or out-of-order row index in the column index given by 'STATS(5)', or zero if no such row index exists.  'STATS(7)' is the number of duplicate or out-of-order row indices.  'STATS(8 : 20)' is always zero in the current version of CCOLAMD (reserved for future use).

     For a symmetric positive definite matrix S, return the permutation vector P such that 'S(P,P)' tends to have a sparser Cholesky factor than S.

     Sometimes 'csymamd' works well for symmetric indefinite matrices too.  The matrix S is assumed to be symmetric; only the strictly lower triangular part is referenced.  S must be square.  The ordering is followed by an elimination tree post-ordering.

     KNOBS is an optional 1-element to 3-element input vector, with a default value of '[10 1 0]'.  Entries not present are set to their defaults.

     'KNOBS(1)'
          If S is n-by-n, then rows and columns with more than 'max(16,KNOBS(1)*sqrt(n))' entries are ignored, and ordered last in the output permutation (subject to the cmember constraints).

     'KNOBS(2)'
          If nonzero, aggressive absorption is performed.

     CMEMBER is an optional vector of length n.  It defines the constraints on the ordering.  If 'CMEMBER(j) = S', then row/column j is in constraint set C (C must be in the range 1 to n).  In the output permutation P, rows/columns in set 1 appear first, followed by all rows/columns in set 2, and so on.  'CMEMBER = ones (1,n)' if not present or empty.

     Compute the Cholesky factor, R, of the symmetric positive definite matrix A.

     The Cholesky factor is defined by

          R' * R = A.

     Called with one output argument 'chol' fails if A or S is not positive definite.  With two or more output arguments P flags whether the matrix was positive definite and 'chol' does not fail.  A zero value indicated that the matrix was positive definite and the R gives the factorization, and P will have a positive value otherwise.

     If called with 3 outputs then a sparsity preserving row/column permutation is applied to A prior to the factorization.  That is R is the factorization of 'A(Q,Q)' such that

          R' * R = Q' * A * Q.

     The sparsity preserving permutation is generally returned as a matrix.  However, given the flag "vector", Q will be returned as a vector such that

          R' * R = A(Q, Q).

     Called with either a sparse or full matrix and using the "lower" flag, 'chol' returns the lower triangular factorization such that

          L * L' = A.

     For full matrices, if the "lower" flag is set only the lower triangular part of the matrix is used for the factorization, otherwise the upper triangular part is used.

     In general the lower triangular factorization is significantly faster for sparse matrices.

     Compute the column approximate minimum degree permutation.

     'P = colamd (S)' returns the column approximate minimum degree permutation vector for the sparse matrix S.  For a non-symmetric matrix S, 'S(:,P)' tends to have sparser LU factors than S.  The Cholesky factorization of 'S(:,P)' * S(:,P)' also tends to be sparser than that of 'S' * S'.

     KNOBS is an optional one- to three-element input vector.  If S is m-by-n, then rows with more than 'max(16,KNOBS(1)*sqrt(n))' entries are ignored.  Columns with more than 'max (16,KNOBS(2)*sqrt(min(m,n)))' entries are removed prior to ordering, and ordered last in the output permutation P.  Only completely dense rows or columns are removed if 'KNOBS(1)' and 'KNOBS(2)' are < 0, respectively.  If 'KNOBS(3)' is nonzero, STATS and KNOBS are printed.  The default is 'KNOBS = [10 10 0]'.  Note that KNOBS differs from earlier versions of colamd.

     STATS is an optional 20-element output vector that provides data about the ordering and the validity of the input matrix S.  Ordering statistics are in 'STATS(1:3)'.  'STATS(1)' and 'STATS(2)' are the number of dense or empty rows and columns ignored by COLAMD and 'STATS(3)' is the number of garbage collections performed on the internal data structure used by COLAMD (roughly of size '2.2 * nnz(S) + 4 * M + 7 * N' integers).

     Octave built-in functions are intended to generate valid sparse matrices, with no duplicate entries, with ascending row indices of the nonzeros in each column, with a non-negative number of entries in each column (!)  and so on.  If a matrix is invalid, then COLAMD may or may not be able to continue.  If there are duplicate entries (a row index appears two or more times in the same column) or if the row indices in a column are out of order, then COLAMD can correct these errors by ignoring the duplicate entries and sorting each column of its internal copy of the matrix S (the input matrix S is not repaired, however).  If a matrix is invalid in other ways then COLAMD cannot continue, an error message is printed, and no output arguments (P or STATS) are returned.  COLAMD is thus a simple way to check a sparse matrix to see if it's valid.

     'STATS(4:7)' provide information if COLAMD was able to continue.  The matrix is OK if 'STATS(4)' is zero, or 1 if invalid.  'STATS(5)' is the rightmost column index that is unsorted or contains duplicate entries, or zero if no such column exists.  'STATS(6)' is the last seen duplicate or out-of-order row index in the column index given by 'STATS(5)', or zero if no such row index exists.  'STATS(7)' is the number of duplicate or out-of-order row indices.  'STATS(8:20)' is always zero in the current version of COLAMD (reserved for future use).

     The ordering is followed by a column elimination tree post-ordering.

     The authors of the code itself are Stefan I. Larimore and Timothy A. Davis <davis@cise.ufl.edu>, University of Florida.

     For a symmetric positive definite matrix S, returns the permutation vector p such that 'S(P, P)' tends to have a sparser Cholesky factor than S.

     Sometimes 'symamd' works well for symmetric indefinite matrices too.  The matrix S is assumed to be symmetric; only the strictly lower triangular part is referenced.  S must be square.

     KNOBS is an optional one- to two-element input vector.  If S is n-by-n, then rows and columns with more than 'max (16,KNOBS(1)*sqrt(n))' entries are removed prior to ordering, and ordered last in the output permutation P.  No rows/columns are removed if 'KNOBS(1) < 0'.  If 'KNOBS (2)' is nonzero, 'stats' and KNOBS are printed.  The default is 'KNOBS = [10 0]'.  Note that KNOBS differs from earlier versions of 'symamd'.

     Compute the convex hull of the set of points PTS.

     PTS is a matrix of size [n, dim] containing n points in a space of dimension dim.

     The hull H is an index vector into the set of points and specifies which points form the enclosing hull.

     An optional second argument, which must be a string or cell array of strings, contains options passed to the underlying qhull command.  See the documentation for the Qhull library for details <http://www.qhull.org/html/qh-quick.htm#options>.  The default options depend on the dimension of the input:

        * 2D, 3D, 4D: OPTIONS = '{"Qt"}'

        * 5D and higher: OPTIONS = '{"Qt", "Qx"}'

     If OPTIONS is not present or '[]' then the default arguments are used.  Otherwise, OPTIONS replaces the default argument list.  To append user options to the defaults it is necessary to repeat the default arguments in OPTIONS.  Use a null string to pass no arguments.

     If the second output V is requested the volume of the enclosing convex hull is calculated.

     Manage FFTW wisdom data.

     Wisdom data can be used to significantly accelerate the calculation of the FFTs, but implies an initial cost in its calculation.  When the FFTW libraries are initialized, they read a system wide wisdom file (typically in '/etc/fftw/wisdom'), allowing wisdom to be shared between applications other than Octave.  Alternatively, the 'fftw' function can be used to import wisdom.  For example,

          WISDOM = fftw ("dwisdom")

     will save the existing wisdom used by Octave to the string WISDOM.  This string can then be saved to a file and restored using the 'save' and 'load' commands respectively.  This existing wisdom can be re-imported as follows

          fftw ("dwisdom", WISDOM)

     If WISDOM is an empty string, then the wisdom used is cleared.

     During the calculation of Fourier transforms further wisdom is generated.  The fashion in which this wisdom is generated is also controlled by the 'fftw' function.  There are five different manners in which the wisdom can be treated:

     "estimate"
          Specifies that no run-time measurement of the optimal means of calculating a particular is performed, and a simple heuristic is used to pick a (probably sub-optimal) plan.  The advantage of this method is that there is little or no overhead in the generation of the plan, which is appropriate for a Fourier transform that will be calculated once.

     "measure"
          In this case a range of algorithms to perform the transform is considered and the best is selected based on their execution time.

     "patient"
          Similar to "measure", but a wider range of algorithms is considered.

     "exhaustive"
          Like "measure", but all possible algorithms that may be used to treat the transform are considered.

     "hybrid"
          As run-time measurement of the algorithm can be expensive, this is a compromise where "measure" is used for transforms up to the size of 8192 and beyond that the "estimate" method is used.

     The default method is "estimate".  The current method can be queried with

          METHOD = fftw ("planner")

     or set by using

          fftw ("planner", METHOD)

     Note that calculated wisdom will be lost when restarting Octave.  However, the wisdom data can be reloaded if it is saved to a file as described above.  Saved wisdom files should not be used on different platforms since they will not be efficient and the point of calculating the wisdom is lost.

     The number of threads used for computing the plans and executing the transforms can be set with

          fftw ("threads", NTHREADS)

     Note that octave must be compiled with multi-threaded FFTW support for this feature.  The number of processors available to the current process is used per default.

     Compute the QR factorization of A, using standard LAPACK subroutines.

     For example, given the matrix 'A = [1, 2; 3, 4]',

          [Q, R] = qr (A)

     returns

          Q =

            -3.16228  -4.42719
             0.00000  -0.63246

     The 'qr' factorization has applications in the solution of least squares problems

          min norm(A x - b)

     for overdetermined systems of equations (i.e., A is a tall, thin matrix).  The QR factorization is 'Q * R = A' where Q is an orthogonal matrix and R is upper triangular.

     If given a second argument of '0', 'qr' returns an economy-sized QR factorization, omitting zero rows of R and the corresponding columns of Q.

     If the matrix A is full, the permuted QR factorization '[Q, R, P] = qr (A)' forms the QR factorization such that the diagonal entries of R are decreasing in magnitude order.  For example, given the matrix 'a = [1, 2; 3, 4]',

          [Q, R, P] = qr (A)

     returns

          Q =

            -0.44721  -0.89443
            -0.89443   0.44721

     The permuted 'qr' factorization '[Q, R, P] = qr (A)' factorization allows the construction of an orthogonal basis of 'span (A)'.

     If the matrix A is sparse, then compute the sparse QR factorization of A, using CSPARSE.  As the matrix Q is in general a full matrix, this function returns the Q-less factorization R of A, such that 'R = chol (A' * A)'.

     If the final argument is the scalar '0' and the number of rows is larger than the number of columns, then an economy factorization is returned.  That is R will have only 'size (A,1)' rows.

     If an additional matrix B is supplied, then 'qr' returns C, where 'C = Q' * B'.  This allows the least squares approximation of 'A \ B' to be calculated as

          [C, R] = qr (A, B)
          x = R \ C

 -- Loadable Function: [Q1, R1] = qrupdate (Q, R, U, V)
     Given a QR factorization of a real or complex matrix A = Q*R, Q unitary and R upper trapezoidal, return the QR factorization of A + U*V', where U and V are column vectors (rank-1 update) or matrices with equal number of columns (rank-k update).  Notice that the latter case is done as a sequence of rank-1 updates; thus, for k large enough, it will be both faster and more accurate to recompute the factorization from scratch.

     The QR factorization supplied may be either full (Q is square) or economized (R is square).

     Perform a symbolic factorization analysis on the sparse matrix S.

     The input variables are

     S
          S is a complex or real sparse matrix.

     TYP
          Is the type of the factorization and can be one of

          'sym'
               Factorize S.  This is the default.

          'col'
               Factorize 'S' * S'.

          'row'
               Factorize S * S'.

          'lo'
               Factorize S'

     MODE
          The default is to return the Cholesky factorization for R, and if MODE is 'L', the conjugate transpose of the Cholesky factorization is returned.  The conjugate transpose version is faster and uses less memory, but returns the same values for COUNT, H, PARENT and POST outputs.

     The output variables are

     COUNT
          The row counts of the Cholesky factorization as determined by TYP.

     H
          The height of the elimination tree.

     PARENT
          The elimination tree itself.

     POST
          A sparse boolean matrix whose structure is that of the Cholesky factorization as determined by TYP.

     Return the symmetric reverse Cuthill-McKee permutation of S.

     P is a permutation vector such that 'S(P, P)' tends to have its diagonal elements closer to the diagonal than S.  This is a good preordering for LU or Cholesky factorization of matrices that come from "long, skinny" problems.  It works for both symmetric and asymmetric S.

     The algorithm represents a heuristic approach to the NP-complete bandwidth minimization problem.  The implementation is based in the descriptions found in

 -- Keyword: unwind_protect
     Begin an unwind_protect block.

     If an error occurs within the first part of an unwind_protect block the commands within the unwind_protect_cleanup block are executed before the error is thrown.  If an error is not thrown, then the unwind_protect_cleanup block is still executed (in other words, the unwind_protect_cleanup will be run with or without an error in the unwind_protect block).
