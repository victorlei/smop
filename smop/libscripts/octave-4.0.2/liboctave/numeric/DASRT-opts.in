OPTION
  NAME = "absolute tolerance"
  DOC_ITEM
Absolute tolerance.  May be either vector or scalar.  If a vector, it
must match the dimension of the state vector, and the relative
tolerance must also be a vector of the same length.

OPTION
  NAME = "relative tolerance"
  DOC_ITEM
Relative tolerance.  May be either vector or scalar.  If a vector, it
must match the dimension of the state vector, and the absolute
tolerance must also be a vector of the same length.

The local error test applied at each integration step is

@example
@group
  abs (local error in x(i)) <= ...
      rtol(i) * abs (Y(i)) + atol(i)
@end group
@end example

OPTION
  NAME = "initial step size"
  DOC_ITEM
Differential-algebraic problems may occasionally suffer from severe
scaling difficulties on the first step.  If you know a great deal
about the scaling of your problem, you can help to alleviate this
problem by specifying an initial stepsize.

  INIT_VALUE = "-1.0"
  SET_EXPR = "(val >= 0.0) ? val : -1.0"
END_OPTION

OPTION
  NAME = "maximum order"
  DOC_ITEM
Restrict the maximum order of the solution method.  This option must
be between 1 and 5, inclusive.

  END_DOC_ITEM
  TYPE = "octave_idx_type"
  INIT_VALUE = "-1"
  SET_EXPR = "val"
END_OPTION

OPTION
  NAME = "maximum step size"
  DOC_ITEM
Setting the maximum stepsize will avoid passing over very large
regions.

  INIT_VALUE = "-1.0"
  SET_EXPR = "(val >= 0.0) ? val : -1.0"

OPTION
  NAME = "step limit"
  DOC_ITEM
Maximum number of integration steps to attempt on a single call to the
underlying Fortran code.
