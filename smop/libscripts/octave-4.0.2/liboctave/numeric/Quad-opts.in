Absolute tolerance; may be zero for pure relative error test.

OPTION
  NAME = "relative tolerance"

Non-negative relative tolerance.  If the absolute tolerance is zero,
the relative tolerance must be greater than or equal to

Absolute tolerance for single precision; may be zero for pure relative
error test.
