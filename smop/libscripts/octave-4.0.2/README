GNU Octave -- a high-level language for numerical computations.

Copyright (C) 1996-2015 John W. Eaton

Overview
--------

GNU Octave is a high-level language, primarily intended for numerical
computations.  It provides a convenient command line interface for
solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically.

GNU Octave is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the
Free Software Foundation; either version 3 of the License, or (at your
option) any later version.

GNU Octave is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the file
COPYING for more details.

Availability
------------

The latest released version of Octave is always available via
anonymous ftp from ftp.gnu.org and its many mirror sites around the
world.  You may also find links to binary distributions at
http://www.octave.org/download.html.  The current development sources
may be found on Savannah (http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/octave)
under the Source Code tab.

Installation
------------

Octave requires approximately 1.4 GB of disk storage to unpack and
compile from source (significantly less, 400 MB, if you don't compile
with debugging symbols).  Once installed, Octave requires
approximately 350 MB of disk space (again, considerably less, 70 MB,
if you don't build shared libraries or the binaries and libraries do
not include debugging symbols).

To compile Octave, you will need a recent version of GNU Make.  You
will also need a recent version of g++ or another ANSI C++ compiler.
You will also need a Fortran 77 compiler or f2c.  If you use f2c, you
will need a script like fort77 that works like a normal Fortran
compiler by combining f2c with your C compiler in a single script.

YOU MUST HAVE GNU MAKE TO COMPILE OCTAVE.  Octave's Makefiles use
features of GNU Make that are not present in other versions of make.
GNU Make is very portable and easy to install.

See the notes in the files INSTALL.OCTAVE and the system-specific README
files in the etc directory of the Octave source distribution for more
specific installation instructions.

Bugs and Patches
----------------

The file BUGS explains the recommended procedure for reporting bugs
or contributing patches.

Documentation
-------------

Octave's manual has been revised for version 3.4, but it is lagging a
bit behind the development of the software.  In particular, there is
currently no complete documentation of the C++ class libraries.  If
you notice omissions or inconsistencies, please report them on the
bug tracker at http://bugs.octave.org.  Specific suggestions for ways
to improve Octave and its documentation are always welcome.  Reports
with patches are even more welcome.

Additional Information
----------------------

Up to date information about Octave is available on the WWW at the
URL http://www.octave.org, including archives of the help, bug, and
maintainers mailing lists.
